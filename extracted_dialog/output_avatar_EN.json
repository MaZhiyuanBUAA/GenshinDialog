            "Good Afternoon\tGood afternoon. I heard your footsteps. My, it certainly is lively outside of the workshop.",
            "Good Evening\t*sigh* It's gotten quiet outside...",
            "Good Night\tGood night, you go ahead and rest. I will just finish one last experiment before bed... If you are interested in the results, I can discuss them with you tomorrow.",

            "About Albedo: Socializing\tRelationships are... *sigh* quite troublesome. Once you establish a relation with someone, you must continue to maintain it; if you lose contact, you must reestablish the relation. This taxing cycle requires...a lot of time.",
            "About Us: Experiments\tYou... want to accompany me while I experiment? I'm honored.\\nOh, don't be nervous. My experiments may be dangerous, but no one gets hurt... most of the time.",
            "About Us: Assistant\tWould you oblige me by serving as my assistant? After observing so many experiments, you surely know a good deal about alchemy by now. Relax, we will work together. I don't think you will have any problems. I have faith in my ability to instruct you, and even more faith in your exceptional talents.",
            "About the Vision\tMy Vision? Ah, that's nothing more than a tool to aid in my experiments, no different from a beaker or crucible. The one thing about it that really intrigues me is the principle behind how it works... One day, I will uncover its secrets. It's only a matter of time.",
            "Something to Share\tThere's something I've always wanted to ask you, but feared rejection and disappointment...\\nAhem... I am very interested in your... little floating companion. May I borrow her to investigate for a short while?",
            "Interesting Things\tYou would like to know more about petrified trees? Um... ahem. Actually, the petrified trees you have come across in domains aren't that ancient. Truly ancient trees usually grow to around one or two miles in height? Oh, and there's a kind of large spider that lives around their roots — if you tie one up in cape jasmine and lemongrass and sprinkle on some cardamom, smoke it for a few hours — you get a fragrant taste that's simply... unforgettable.",
            "About Family\tFamily? Although Alice has always asked me to call her \"Mother,\" when I think of the idea of \"family,\" my master comes to mind first. My earliest memories in life are of going on adventures with her. She taught me the art of alchemy and much knowledge about the world. Perhaps... even the words \"family\" and \"master\" are incapable of fully expressing her meaning to me.",
            "About Sucrose: Direction\tSucrose? I think I more or less understand why she is so dedicated to her research in bio-alchemy... Either way, I'm happy to see her succeed more and more in her endeavors.",
            "About Sucrose: Habits\tWorking with Sucrose on alchemy research is quite pleasant, but she has some... stubborn qualities in regards to certain aspects unrelated to research. For example, I have told her numerous times to just call me \"Albedo\" since we are about the same age, but she insists on addressing me in an excessively formal manner. *sigh* ...Whatever she prefers, I guess.",
            "About Lisa\tLisa? I always am impressed by the valuable perspectives she brings to discussions. But is a person with her talents satisfied with such a basic occupation as librarian? There must be some hidden reason for this.",
            "About Klee\tIndeed, I view Klee as my younger sister. Whenever she gets herself into some explosive sort of trouble, I can only console myself with the fact that her current destructiveness is nothing compared to that of Miss Alice.",
            "About Jean\tJean? She has served exceptionally well as Acting Grand Master. One can even say she is more reliable than Grand Master Varka. Perhaps in our hearts, we all eagerly await the day she can become the official Grand Master herself.",
            "About Xingqiu\tOh, Xingqiu? I find his written works quite interesting. The Yae Publishing House in Inazuma has been asking that I cooperate with a different author for greater royalties. Hmph, do I seem the type to be swayed by a few extra Mora?",
            "About Barbara\tBarbara? She's a very earnest Deaconess. I once had the opportunity to sketch her a simple portrait... What happened to the sketch? Ah yes... Albert offered to purchase it, but I rejected his bid and gave it to the Acting Grand Master. Social relations... really require a lot of effort.",
            "More About Albedo: I\tHave a question for me? Go ahead, ask. It doesn't take too long to ask a single question, does it? I'm about to begin the final stage of an experiment...",
            "More About Albedo: II\tOh, by the way. Did you know that without human manipulation, you would need to harness the power of a sun eight times the size of our own in order to naturally create gold?",
            "More About Albedo: III\tThe time required to sketch portraits closely correlates with one's mood. I could spend half a day sketching Huffman, while I might only need three strokes of the pencil to sketch Kaeya — one for the face, one for the eyepatch string... and one for the eyepatch.",
            "More About Albedo: IV\tWhat do I do besides sketching and research...? I will occasionally read novels from Inazuma and Liyue. They contain many fascinating ideas which can sometimes provide me with unexpected inspirations for my own creations.",
            "More About Albedo: V\tEven now, I find the nigredo processing stage of alchemy passed down by my master to be full of mystery. What did my master want to create using this technique...? My research is far from over. I will require your help to investigate further.",
            "Albedo's Hobbies\tHmm... Besides research, the activity I spend most of my time on is probably sketching. At first I saw it simply as a way to better study the structure of living things and materials so as to aid me in my experiments, but it eventually became a hobby of mine. Indeed, it is a very good way to relax.",
            "Albedo's Troubles\tThere's just never enough time, is there? Even when I remove the most troublesome matters from my schedule, I still can't find enough time for everything.",
            "Favorite Food\tI really do enjoy having dessert. How can I put it...? When both physical and mental capacity are spent, high-energy materials further provide a kind of primordial, highly-effective boost.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tWhat food do I dislike? ...Large portions of meat at restaurants. I have a rather small appetite, so a meal like that only ends up in tragedy — either I overeat and the joy of the taste is lost, or I don't finish it and the food is wasted. I decided to simply not go to restaurants, although that has also meant I must spend more time preparing my own food...",
            "Birthday\tHappy birthday. You look especially happy, would you mind if I sketched you? The capacity of our brains is limited, so we are bound to forget things. But when an image is transferred onto paper or canvas, the sketch becomes an extension of our memory. We can remember that past feeling when we later look at the sketch.",

            "Character Details\tAlchemy is an ancient art, and many of its secrets have been lost to history. The few commonly known alchemy techniques of today are but enough to put some broken odds and ends together, saving you the money you would have otherwise spent on glue.\\n\"Nay, alchemy is not so ignoble an art!\" Or so most alchemists would protest.\\nBut as far as the average citizen of Mondstadt was concerned, that was alchemy.\\nAt least until the day Albedo suddenly appeared and decided to stay in Mondstadt.\\nThis young man displayed the true prowess of alchemy to all, bringing with him a massive corpus of wisdom that even the Sumeru Academia did not possess. \"The universe is heaven reversed, and the earth is a dream lost to time. This is dust, the most basic form of complex life.\"\\nAs if to provide evidence for this claim, Albedo lifted the burnt ash of the flower that once grew atop a Dendro Slime's head.\\nSeconds later, a Cecilia sprouted forth from the ash in his hand.\\n\"And this... is new birth.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tAlbedo has a very important job within the Knights of Favonius but does not often appear in public.\\nStill, he does not have the strange and eccentric temper that people tend to assume of academics. In fact, he is earnest in all his dealings.\\nHe is, however, of the persuasion that it requires more energy to maintain relationships established on excessive enthusiasm.\\nAs a result, Albedo's equivalent of friendship involves maintaining an appropriate degree of distance.\\nWhether shutting himself away to work or traveling and gathering materials, no one in Mondstadt knows how to find him.\\nAlbedo's tendency to avoid social interactions does not make him a cold-hearted person.\\nHe is sincere and contented when instructing his assistants, Timaeus and Sucrose.\\nHe finds pleasure in giving his sketches to the citizens of Mondstadt.\\nYet he cannot help but feel sincere disappointment that Lisa, for all her great talents, has chosen to remain a mere Librarian.",
            "Character Story 2\t\"Albedo only got into Mondstadt because of his master's recommendation letter.\"\\nOn some level, this statement is true. Nevertheless, Monstadt's gates are ever open to all, and a recommendation letter is not strictly necessary.\\nIndeed, it could be argued that Albedo's life would have been far more comfortable without the letter.\\nThis is because the recipient of the letter was the famed travel writer Alice, an old friend of Albedo's master, Rhinedottir.\\nAfter receiving the letter, Alice considered its requests.\\n\"So Rhine said that you'll need a laboratory... And not one of a size that a civilian could build, either. Hmm... I know!\"\\nAnd just like that, she threw him into the Knights of Favonius.\\nThe work of the Knights is actually quite easy for Albedo — requiring only five percent of his energy.\\nAlbedo had imagined that the rest of his energy could be spent on experiments, with the Knights' full range of apparatus at his disposal.\\nAnd yet...\\nAlice had a daughter, named Klee.\\nYes, \"that\" Klee.\\n\"We'll be a family from now on, treat her like a real younger sister!\"\\nFrom that day forth, remedying Klee's disasters would come to take up most of Albedo's remaining energy...",
            "Character Story 3\tAlbedo has no memory of any blood relations. From birth, he was already adventuring deep within domains with his master.\\nOf course, Miss Alice, the Knights of Favonius, and that traveler who had a sense of the stellar depths about them... They are all important. And yet his master is unquestionably the most special to him.\\nFor Albedo, she is his only kin.\\nShe was a cold and strict woman who raised him and taught him the secrets of alchemy.\\n\"The universe is the dark essence of the true starry sky, and the earth is the accumulated memories of time and lives.\\nThe chalk: that is you. The earth is where alchemy gets its name, and is the basis of all life. And this...\"\\nShe demonstrated her technique before him as a huge life form burst from its culture tank in a shower of shattered fragments.\\n\"...This is new birth.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tAlbedo once led a simple and contented existence.\\nIt was a life free of considerations, but dull in its monotony. His purpose centered on accompanying his teacher, executing her orders, and meeting her expectations.\\nBut one day, deep in the heart of a dungeon, teacher and apprentice discovered an artifact known as The Heart of Naberius.\\nFrom then on, his teacher disappeared, leaving naught but a single note, a recommendation letter, and a classical text.\\nUpon the note was written: \"Albedo, go to Mondstadt. Find my old friend, Alice, and give her the recommendation letter. Complete your final assignment.\"\\nThe classical text was one of the last extant manuscripts of the Opus Magnum, which his teacher had kept with her.\\nIf one were to push the definition a little, she had left him another gift — the title of Kreideprinz, and with it, the acknowledgment that she had nothing further to teach him.\\nIn the past, Albedo's assignments had always been very difficult.\\nHe had always believed wholeheartedly that his teacher would make good on her threat to leave him, should he fail.\\nBut this assignment she had left to him was far too hard, far beyond the limit of his abilities.\\nDid this mean, then, that he was fated to never complete it, and thus never see his teacher again?\\n\"Your final assignment: show me the truth and the meaning of this world.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tThe alchemy that Albedo commands is wholly different from any of the arts practiced in the Seven Nations of Teyvat.\\nIts lineage can be traced back to the nation of Khaenri'ah.\\nKhaenri'ah was an underground realm, and its natural fauna were few indeed. As such, its alchemy focused more heavily on the creation of life.\\nThis art of creation was known as \"The Art of Khemia.\"\\nAlbedo had learned of this in his youth from reading his master's notes.\\n The next stage after \"soil\" is \"chalk,\" which was also something his master had mentioned.\\n\"Chalk is the spotless soil, and was used to make primordial man.\"\\nNow, Albedo understands alchemy in far greater depth than he did in the beginning, having also consolidated his understanding of knowledge.\\n\"From soil was birthed chalk.\"\\nThe profundity of this statement is well understood by Albedo.\\nSuch incomprehensible statements are bound up in the memories of his master.\\nHis master was not his birth mother, but Albedo has no doubt that his life stems from her nonetheless.\\n\"I hope I'm not overthinking things. When parents tell their children of 'the meaning of this world'... They must mean living a happy life, right?\"\\nFrom time to time, Albedo finds himself musing on this sentiment.",
            "Albedo's Artwork\tAlbedo developed his drawing habit while traveling with his master.\\nAt first, he would simply illustrate his notes. But eventually, he would discover that drawing the details helped him to understand the physical makeup of the objects he examined, being of great utility to his alchemical studies.\\nIndeed, drawing allowed him to enter a pleasant state of clarity — one in which the only things on his mind were his observations and the work in front of him.\\nThus, Albedo became a master artist without ever having received formal training.\\nWhen strolling through Mondstadt, he enjoys capturing still life, particularly people in moments of joy.\\nSometimes, he even gives his artwork to his unsuspecting \"models,\" believing that such transient enjoyment, crystallized in a single moment, is something to treasure.\\nAlbedo continued to refine his skills in this manner — until one day when he was taken aback by illustrations from Inazuma.\\nHow was it that drawings of such generality could possess such narrative power?\\nAmazed, he decided to give it a go himself.\\n...Eventually, after collaborating with a certain novelist by the name of Xingqiu, \"A Legend of Sword\" was printed and published.\\nUnfortunately, it received middling reviews, being lambasted as \"a dictionary with divine illustrations.\"",
            "Vision\tGaining a Vision came as little surprise to Albedo.\\nIndeed, when he received it, he gave it a single glance before carrying on with what he was doing before.\\nHe barely felt any wave of emotion at all, as if this was something to be taken for granted.\\nAs far as he is concerned, his Vision is merely a tool with which he can more conveniently conduct his research.\\nThat which truly sparks joy within him is turning the unknown into the known.\\nOne day, he will understand all there is to know about this world — and Visions themselves are no exception."

            "Character Story 1\tFrom a young age, Amber has always had boundless energy and a positive outlook on life.\\nEach day, she burns with a fiery enthusiasm that sees her go about her life like a whirlwind, smashing through any obstacle that stands in her way.\\nAt times, however, her excessive energy can make her quite the troublemaker.\\nNeedless to say, she was quite a handful when she was young. Her infamous deeds include accidentally dropping a bird's nest on her grandpa's head while trying to steal the eggs from it and setting a Dendro Slime's leaves on fire, causing it to scurry about like a wild animal. These minor offenses gained her some notoriety among hunters' camps.\\nSomehow, Amber was always able to escape the scene of the crime whenever she caused an incident, and not even a veteran outrider could catch up with her. Invariably, it was Amber's grandpa who ended up on damage control duty each time his granddaughter's misbehavior caused yet another incident.\\nTo Amber, her grandpa's silent, unconditional love was like a warm breeze that wrapped around her like a blanket. She knew that it was because of this love that he accepted her and took responsibility for her deeds, and she embraced it silently.\\nBut it was only on the day that her grandpa resigned from the Knights of Favonius that she finally understood the full extent of the responsibility he had borne all those years.",
            "Character Story 2\tAmber's grandpa was once the leader of a mercenary group. He came from Liyue Harbor and was tasked with protecting merchant caravans as they traversed Teyvat. One day, on a routine escort job, the caravan fell prey to a savage monster attack; he was the only survivor, saved by a doctor from the Knights of Favonius.\\nToo ashamed to return home and anxious to repay the debt, Amber's grandpa joined the Knights of Favonius.\\nBefore long, he single-handedly founded the Outriders, trained each one of them personally, and began leading them on missions.\\nIt also wasn't long before he found love in the foreign land of Mondstadt and founded a family.\\nYears later, Amber was born into that family. During the day, she would crouch by the window and secretly watch him training the outriders; at night, she would sneak into the yard and practice the moves he had taught that day.\\nAmber's grandpa was touched by her enthusiasm, and decided to teach her everything he knew.\\n\"When Mondstadt accepted me, it became my homeland. Then, I decided to watch over this new home of mine. Maybe one day, you will inherit this responsibility... Hah, but then, who knows what the future holds?\"\\nAs the coarse skin of her grandpa's palm rubbed against her head, a bewildered but earnest Amber nodded energetically in response.",
            "Character Story 3\tSomething happened one day four years ago that profoundly changed Amber.\\nThat day, her grandpa left his coat of arms and sword in his office and simply disappeared, leaving no note and telling no one he was leaving.\\nHe had been the beating heart and the backbone of the Outrider division, and without his leadership they rapidly became undisciplined and lost their edge.\\nA few failed operations later, the Outrider division was facing obsoletion. In the end, it was preserved as a part of the Knights' organization, but in name only. Experienced members either transferred to another detachment or resigned, and so few outriders stayed that they simply did not have enough people to fulfill their daily patrol duties.\\nOn top of this, rumors that Amber's grandpa had defected made recovery even more difficult for the struggling Outrider division.\\nAmber personally experienced this entire episode, having just been admitted to the Outriders before it all began. With the decline of her squad, she experienced true loss and disappointment for the first time in her life. No longer her carefree former self, she was filled with a new determination: She was going to grow up and become a true outrider as quickly as possible, no matter what it took.\\nShe had never made an actual plan before, and lacked the maturity to know where to start. But what she did have was confidence and courage — and lots of it.\\nShe wanted to show she had inherited her grandpa's determination, and she wanted to find out where he had gone.\\nBut more importantly, she wanted to inherit her grandpa's former role and become a loyal protector of her homeland.",
            "Character Story 4\tLife in the Knights of Favonius was not easy for Amber in the beginning.\\nBeing as young as she was and having just lived through the trauma of losing her grandpa, the senior knights made a point of taking special care of her.\\nHowever, for a girl as desperate to excel as she was, being taken care of by others implied that she wasn't yet mature enough to stand on her own two feet.\\nAccordingly, she voraciously sought out extra responsibilities and made this as visible as possible to her seniors.\\nFinally, during an intense engagement with some monsters, the seniors noticed her bravery and resourcefulness in the heat of battle.\\nThat was the moment when they realized that their little girl was growing up.\\nAs she matured, she also became more at ease with herself. Whatever feedback she met with, be it praise, rebuke, silence, or taunting, her response was always the same.\\n\"For sure, I may still have a way to go before I catch up with my seniors. But one day, I'm gonna be the best Outrider ever!\"\\nAmber is not prone to too much deliberation, preferring instead to speak her mind, truthfully and frankly, at every occasion.\\nShe firmly believes that she will not disappoint her grandpa.",
            "Character Story 5\tToday, Amber is still the firecracker she always was, burning with endless passion and energy.\\nNow that she's all grown up, Amber holds firm to her grandpa's teachings as she spreads her Wind Glider's wings and watches over the City of Freedom with the eye of an eagle and the cautious cunning of a bunny rabbit.\\nThe \"Crimson Knight\" is known throughout Mondstadt.\\nThe people are delighted to see the mischievous little girl they remember growing up to be a guardian they can rely on.\\n\"Never fear, Outrider Amber is here!\"\\nHer self-confidence is simply unshakable:\\n\"I am Outrider Amber, the one and only outrider — which makes me the best one out there!\"",
            "Amber's Journal\tAmber doesn't make writing a daily diary a habit, only electing to write special or memorable events down in her journal.\\n\"I finally caught that magical bird! It's called a Rami... something. I don't remember. But I've been chasing it for three days, and I've only been able to sit down for a proper meal today. That magical bird was a really cunning one, burrowing in the thick forest like that. Good thing I didn't give up! Best of all, Master Jean gave me special permission to pluck a feather plume from it as my reward. Hehe, I'll wear it at my side every single day!\"\\n\"I'm sure I followed the cookbook to the letter and grilled the meat for six minutes. But while the outside is charred, the inside isn't cooked yet... Did I not control the heat properly? But I really am hungry, so I'll just have to try again tomorrow. One day, I'll make the best steak, and I'll call it... the Outrider's Champion Steak!\"\\n\"I met a strange outlander today. I was suspicious at first, but as it turns out, this outlander is both reliable and capable. Ugh, come to think of it, what would I do if an enemy that strong showed up? ...I musn't fall behind. I must train harder!\"",
            "Vision\tAmber once believed that if she took on her grandpa's post, she would understand why he left Mondstadt.\\nHowever, even when she officially became an Outrider, she was no closer to unraveling the mystery behind his wordless departure.\\nHer grandpa had left nothing for her to find either, indicating that she would have to forge her own path.\\nAmber floundered for a while, until she flipped through an old book of fables that she would eventually come to treasure.\\n\"What you lacked was not wind, but courage. It is courage that has allowed you to become the first flying birds of this world.\"\\nAmber realized that she shouldn't wait for directions from someone else, but that she should be like those courageous birds that spread their wings and flew into the blue skies.\\n\"There must be something that only I can do. There must be.\"\\nThe moment she realized this, a Vision began to shine brightly at her hip."

            "Character Story 1\tEvery citizen of Mondstadt adores Barbara.\\nHowever, this has not always been the case. At first, Barbara's songs sounded strange to the citizens of Mondstadt, and many struggled to see the appeal.\\nThis was because for the longest time, the folk songs of bards were the only popular songs known in Mondstadt.\\nFortunately, Mondstadt stayed true to its reputation as the City of Freedom, and the people ultimately embraced the new while continuing to cherish the old.\\nPeople accepted Barbara's songs, and over time her positive energy rubbed off on them. Soon, they could be heard humming her tunes all around Mondstadt.\\n\"Albert, would you stop please! You're completely out of tune!\"",
            "Character Story 2\tBarbara's feelings on her own success are mixed.\\nTo the extent that an idol's duty is to make everyone adore her, she has done a fantastic job.\\nThere is no doubting that she has made the right choice.\\nHowever, an idol is also expected to spread joy and relieve people's spiritual fatigue... Has she really accomplished that?\\nShe sang for blind Glory, encouraging her to believe that her lover would one day return. She sang, too, for sick Anna, promising her that her illness would one day be cured.\\nYet, the smiles on their faces never last long after the songs end.\\nThis has led Barbara to become somewhat disillusioned and doubtful.",
            "Character Story 3\tBarbara has always been a bright and optimistic girl since she was young. Though at times she can be a bit clumsy and mess things up, she always bounces right back and has another go.\\nBarbara is the complete opposite of her sister, who is seen by all as the pride of her family.\\nUnlike Barbara, her sister has always been the very definition of success in all aspects.\\nInitially, all Barbara had ever wanted was to surpass her sister in at least one thing, even if only once.\\nHowever, be it swordplay, her grades, or anything else, she was never able to compare.\\nEven for someone as optimistic as her, she found herself to be upset and down.\\n\"Hard work is the most miraculous magic. But when even that doesn't work... what then?\"",
            "Character Story 4\tBarbara has never once considered giving up.\\nHer determination and resilience even surprised her father, Seamus Pegg, the Cardinal of Daybreak.\\nBarbara only allows herself to be depressed for 30 seconds.\\nAfter that, she forces herself to brighten up, no matter what.\\n\"I'm not so good in combat, so I'll be sure to support those who are.\"\\nUnder her father's counsel, Barbara became a healer.\\nShe is as radiant as the sick and injured are pained.\\nHer desire to be recognized gradually transformed into a simple desire to help others.",

I feel so much better.\"\\nTo Barbara, the greatest reward is seeing the smiles on people's faces.\\nTherefore, whenever she is massaging her swollen calves or drinking tea to care for her sore throat, Barbara recalls all those who have been kind to her.\\n\"It's the encouragement I receive from others that keeps me going.\"\\nJust maybe, the smiles she receives are proof that her songs really can heal people.\\nHer ambition to surpass her sister and become the most popular person in all of Mondstadt hasn't been abandoned by Barbara, it is simply buried deep inside her heart.\\n\"If only I excelled more, perhaps I could be of help to Jean.\"\\nThis is what she believes.\\n\"Okay... Barbara, go!\"",
            "Alice's Idol Magazine\t\"...Idol?\"\\nThe first time that Barbara heard this strange word, she was visibly confused.\\n\"But... aren't The Seven the ones that people are supposed to worship?\"\\n\"Yes, but not exclusively...\" replied Alice, an elder of the Hexenzirkel, as she groomed the young girl for stardom. \"Read this, it contains everything you will need to know.\"\\n\"Idol Magazine\" was the name of the assigned reading material. Barbara had no idea what world this magazine had come from, but by reading it she found out that there was indeed such thing as an \"idol,\" and that it mainly involved working hard at getting everyone to like you.\\nShe also discovered that an outstanding idol is capable of not just bringing joy to themselves, but also bringing spiritual healing to others through the power of song and dance.\\nBarbara set about learning one new song after another, dancing to the beat as she went. Finally, she found happiness, and she found it in the smiling faces of others.\\nSome time later, when Alice anxiously relayed to Barbara that plans for \"Teyvat Idols!\" were falling through, Barbara was starting to make a name for herself through her performances in Mondstadt.\\n\"Hmm... Well, if I'm the only one left... I guess you can leave it to me to define what it really means to be an idol!\"\\nDriven by this ever so slightly selfish ambition to spread joy and healing to others, Barbara is slyly swotting up on new tunes behind the scenes to this very day.",
            "Vision\tThe story of how Barbara obtained her Vision is hardly the typical tale of high-stakes heroism.\\nShe had just joined the church and was looking after a little boy with a high and persisting fever.\\nNothing Barbara could think of would console the boy and bring an end to his relentless tears.\\nSomeone remarked that while the boy had already taken his medicine, there was no way to cure the pain of missing one's family.\\nAnother suggested that Barbara sing a song for the boy to raise his spirits.\\nBarbara had never sung a song in her life up until this point, but how could she shy away from it in a moment like this?\\n\"Never having sung before is no reason to abandon a child in their time of need,\" Barbara thought to herself.\\nAnd so, Barbara took the boy in her arms and sang him a song: a lullaby, the only song she knew.\\nIt was an unceremonious beginning to her singing career. After quickly realizing that she barely knew any of the words, she had to resort to humming the tune instead.\\nNevertheless, her voice began to soothe the child, and so she kept singing. She sang the same song, over and over again, until her throat was dry and her voice was hoarse. Finally, the boy fell asleep. Exhausted, Barbara lay down by the wall and fell straight asleep herself.\\nEarly the next morning, Barbara awoke to discover that the boy's fever had come down. Perhaps it was because she had sung for him, or perhaps it had something to do with the Vision which had mysteriously appeared next to her hand at some point during the night.\\nBarbara was not preoccupied with the Vision, however. It was the sight of the boy smiling once again that filled her heart with joy.\\nBarbara received her Vision for the simple but beautiful wish that took hold in her heart that night: A dream of healing the sick through the power of song."

        "story": [
            "Character Details\tBeidou is the leader of The Crux — an armed crew based in Liyue Harbor.\\nAn armed crew means exactly what it sounds like: a crew of sailors armed to the teeth.\\nWithout getting into too many details, everything The Crux does is approved by the Qixing... more or less.\\nBeidou is a trusted leader, so much so that her crew believe her capable of taming the storms and billows on the sea.\\n\"It's Beidou! Even the mightiest of storms must bow its head to her might!\"",
            "Character Story 1\tBeidou is something of a cultural icon in Liyue.\\nThough her fame does not quite reach the same lofty heights as that of the Liyue Qixing, one can be certain that every merchant in the city knows her name — and that of her crew, The Crux.\\nNaturally, there are rumors abound regarding someone of her status. People love to tell epic tales of her earth-shattering (or rather, sea-splitting) feats.; tales in which her abilities are exaggerated to almost superhuman levels.\\nOne rumor is that she can channel Electro energy with her sword. It is said that she once used it to cut a formidable sea monster from the depths of the ocean abyss in half with just one hit.\\nBystanders who overhear such tales generally dismiss them as drunken ramblings. But to any who have ever voyaged with Beidou themselves, these stories are no joke. In their view, if this world really were home to a giant sea monster from the ocean abyss... Beidou would certainly be capable of cutting it in half.\\nIn summary, Beidou's abilities are every bit as impressive as her reputation in business circles. So if you hear her lauded as the Uncrowned Lord of the Ocean — suffice to say that there is no smoke without fire.",
            "Character Story 2\tBusiness people tend to put profit before their humanity. This is just accepted as the way of the world; at most, it makes for some light verbal sparring at the dinner table.\\nBut things are different in Liyue, where everyone is involved in business. They reject the notion entirely, claiming that Liyue Harbor is a special place where humanity is sacred.\\nForeign merchants will retort that the only thing special about Liyue is that \"They've managed to commodify humanity, too!\" To this, Liyue locals respond, \"Then how do you explain The Crux?\"\\nWith The Crux having made a name for itself over many years, their services are extremely expensive to charter. And yet, on one voyage when The Crux encountered a strong storm, Beidou noticed a small private boat nearby. Seeing the way it was tossed about by the waves, she ordered her crew to tow the boat to safety — despite the risk that her ship's keel might give way. What little food and water the fleet had left, Beidou shared with the rescued crew as she navigated her vessel onward through the raging storm.\\nFinally, after several days, The Crux delivered the rescued boat to a safe mooring spot. Grateful to Beidou for saving their lives, the crew of the rescued boat became her loyal trade partners thereafter.\\nAfter Liyue locals recount this story, they smile and insist, \"When you have someone risking their life like that, you can be sure that it takes far more than commodification to explain their actions! Would you really dare to look Beidou in the eyes and talk about the commodification of humanity?\"",
            "Character Story 3\tWord has it that The Crux's boss behind the curtains is none other than the Qixing's Tianquan, Ningguang, herself.\\nBoth of the people involved deny this outright, though they do so for different reasons.\\nAs a member of the Qixing, Ningguang often needs someone else to do her dirty work for her. Of the many candidates available, she picked Beidou.\\nNingguang would emphasize that she picked Beidou, not The Crux; Ningguang's collaboration with The Crux is, therefore, purely incidental.\\nMeanwhile, when Beidou hears the rumors about her dealings with Ningguang, she furiously insists that she collaborates with Ningguang on an equal footing: Beidou is her own boss and no one, not even Ningguang, is sitting in the background pulling the strings for her.\\nBeidou is certainly unique among Ningguang's collaborators.\\nShe does not tread carefully or show reverence in the way that most of them do. In fact, one could even say Beidou is sometimes at odds with Ningguang.\\nNingguang's advisers worry constantly that Beidou is too unpredictable and too much of a maverick. But Ningguang simply smiles and dismisses their concerns.\\n\"On the contrary, Beidou is the most reliable person in Liyue,\" she replies. \"Just tell her the truth, as well as what's in it for her, and she'll come around in her own time.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tOnce, after disembarking from a long voyage, The Crux held its customary three-day celebratory banquet. It was a fall like any other before it — except for the new chef in town. This was Xiangling, the head chef-to-be of the Wanmin Restaurant.\\nLooking to keep costs down, they lured Xiangling onboard after meeting her on the streets, by hook and by crook. When she saw Beidou, Xiangling was dismayed, and let Beidou know this in no uncertain terms: \"If you want to have Yue-style seafood, then I can't agree to help you. I'll have you know that I intend to transcend Liyue's two warring culinary styles with my cooking...\"\\nBeidou merely smiled and gestured to the chest of gold coins beside her: \"Just do what you're good at. We made quite a bit on our last run. How does a retainer of fifty thousand Mora sound?\"\\nNot one to shy away for a chance to prove the worth of her cooking, Xiangling took the job.\\nWhen the day was done, Beidou was indeed won over by Xiangling's skill. She declared in front of her crew that Xiangling would soon be a renowned chef throughout Liyue. She also insisted that they refer to her as \"Madam Xiangling.\"\\nHaving only begun to make her name, Xiangling admired Beidou for her generosity with money and her direct personality. Thereafter, Xiangling would sail with Beidou often, looking for new and exotic seafood ingredients. She found herself surprised by Beidou's vast knowledge of seafood and their culinary preparation, given how far she usually was from any kitchen.\\nOf course, that didn't mean Xiangling would necessarily heed Beidou's advice on whether something was edible or not...but that is a story for another time.",
            "Character Story 5\tSome say an object takes after its master.\\nThough it may not be a suitable description, The Crux crew does indeed take after Beidou, exhibiting the same qualities.\\nHowever, there are still secrets among the crew, spreading in places unnoticed by Beidou.\\nHer First Mate always takes new sailors out after their first safe return for drinks and fills them in on the details of an old story:\\nIn the past, the crew went on a journey to brave the unknown seas and found itself at death's door in a horrific storm.\\nAt that time, Beidou stood on the deck behind the wheel, singing a Liyue fishermen's song in the storm.\\n\"...all the way until the waves died down and dawn broke on the far horizon...\"\\nThe First Mate often ends the story with this final line and a look of longing on his face.\\nAs business grew and the crew expanded, more and more outrageously incredible details were added to the story, making the rookies worship Beidou like a goddess.",
            "Pier Laborers' Gossip\t1. Facing a three-headed hydra of unrivaled girth, Beidou hurled forth her greatsword. Spinning in the air, it sliced clean through all three of the hydra's vertebrae, before returning to her waiting hand.\\n2. Beidou has beaten Ningguang at chess. Twice. The important part is not so much that she did win Ningguang's money, but more that she dared to.\\n3. Since the day she slew the sea monster Haishan, Beidou has never sung a fishermen's shanty ever again.\\n4. Yes, Beidou knows shanties. But don't you dare ask her that to her face. I mean, you know how that hydra ended up, don't you...",
            "Vision\tLiyue and Inazuma share a common saying: \"Its fins formed the ocean deep, its tail the mountains high.\" The fishermen learned this phrase while ashore long ago, and sang it over and over, spreading the tune far and wide till it became the much-loved song people know today. Whenever the mists gather over the sea's surface, one can hear the distant song of the fishermen hidden in the white shroud: \"its fins formed the oceans deep, its tail the mountains high...\"\\nThis was Beidou's childhood lullaby. The tale of Rex Lapis smiting the sea monsters had become legendary among the people of Liyue. As a child, Beidou loved tales like this, and in her dreams, she thought: One day, I want to see this big fish too.\\nThis day, however, she sang this song with a different emotion in her heart. Her entire crew sang along as they sailed.\\nHaishan was in the waters with them — at once like a dragon and a fish, it was larger than any could have imagined in their worst nightmares, and mighty as a deity, raising waves dozens of meters high with ease.\\nAll who ply their trade on the high seas are destined to meet Haishan eventually. Beidou had longed to do so since she was nine, dreaming of slicing its head off in a single blow.\\nMany times she had challenged the creature, and many times she had failed. But this day was different. This day she charged at Haishan with her best greatsword in hand, and crack sailors at her back.\\nThe battle would rage fiercely for four days. With cannons and harpoons, arrows and ropes the fleet would assail Haishan, while Beidou battled the thusly tied-down creature for ten hours, well into the night.\\nNow, nighttime was when Haishan was in its element, and in their vigilance not a single member of the fleet dared sleep a wink. Beidou stood upon the prow, listening to the wind.\\nOne strike. Just one strike. That was all she needed. And so she waited, unmoving, in the freezing wind.\\nThen, at the crack of dawn, having neither eaten nor drank throughout the night, Beidou heard a change in the sound of the waves.\\nWith one almighty strike that sounded as if it could have sliced the moon in two or ripped a mountain from the face of the world, she chopped the leviathan's head clean off!\\nThe sound of thunder filled the heavens, and a single bolt of purple lightning struck the ocean right in front of Beidou, even as she bathed in the blood of her nemesis.\\nThus descended a Vision to the slayer of the sea monster, its violet glow as stunning as lightning, and its immaculate, jeweled form a treasure more precious than dragon blood. A suitably divine gift for the hero who subdued Haishan."

            "Character Story 1\tThe adventurer Jack was the first victim of Benny's Adventure Team.\\nJust a few feet away from the treasure, an extremely rare Geo Turbulence occurred, tearing the ground apart and opening a bottomless chasm right before everyone's eyes.\\n\"So close, yet so far... like love.\"\\nJack only suffered minor injuries, but he was never the same as an adventurer thereafter; the event seemed to have left him with a broken heart.\\nAnother member, Royce, heard someone shout \"Heyo!\" before losing consciousness in a huge explosion. The culprit, Klee, was sent to the confinement room for seven days for mistaking the cave the adventurers were still exploring in for a giant rabbit hole and blowing it up.\\nHeckler suffered from a severe bout of diarrhea for a week after joining the team. Although it turned out to be food poisoning, he insisted it was because of Bennett's bad luck.\\n\"They'll be back! They're just... on leave. Please don't invalidate my team's registration with the Guild...\"\\nSeeing Bennett beg and plead before her eyes, Katheryne sighed and decided to spare him the truth that his \"teammates\" had long jumped ship.",

But how could he explain that which lay before him?\\nIn that moment, it hit him, and he believed it to be true.\\n\"This baby must be... a child abandoned by the world itself.\"\\nThough there were no mighty artifacts, jewelry, or gold, the old man's face did not seem disappointed in the slightest, for he regarded this baby, whose life hung by a mere thread, to be his treasure.\\n\"This child is what I was meant to find on this journey,\" he thought as he took the baby into his arms.\\nEven if what he was about to do opposed the will of the world itself, he was unafraid.",

Where are the undergarments I bought you?\", \"Dad, it's raining, better keep your distance from me so you don't get struck by lightning!\"\\nTaking care of all his aging dads who have no family has taken up most of his time outside of adventuring.\\n\"The dads certainly have found a treasure, haha!\"\\nCyrus, the current Guild Master, laughed, giving Bennett a pat on the back.\\nThough he is unlucky himself, he can at least try to bring luck to those he cares about. At least, that's how Bennett feels.\\nBennett the Unlucky still strives to find his own lucky treasure through his series of unfortunate events.",

A wealth of \"unfortunate events\" has taught Bennett how to deal with more of them in the future.\\nBarbara, the Deaconess at the Church of Favonius, was once surprised by how skilled Bennett is at treating dislocated joints.\\nAnother gift from his ordeals is his jaw-dropping talent for combat.\\n\"Look at his moves... Doesn't that hurt?\" Grand Master Varka of the Knights was extremely intrigued after seeing Bennett in combat.\\nIt's not that Bennett doesn't feel pain — he has simply gotten used to it. He adapted to the pain as others would to pungent smells or blinding light.\\nTherefore, the way Bennett dives into battles head-on without reservation has become something of a signature of his.",

He sticks those bandages on his wounds with the care of one pinning a medal to their chest, before thanking her wholeheartedly.\\nBennett keeps many such bandages in his utility pouch when he goes on adventures. Ones he gets from his dads, from Barbara, from Katheryne... and from adventurers he sometimes meets by chance after getting injured.\\nThese tiny tokens of goodwill form a tangible collection of fair fortune unique to Bennett.\\n\"Well, since everyone's by my side, I guess I'm not that unlucky after all.\"",
            "Vision\tBennett's passion for adventure is unstoppable.\\nHe wants to constantly explore, challenge, sweat it out, and eventually grow old on the adventurer's path.\\nBut there was once when he met with a true crisis.\\nJust as that old adventurer had so long ago, Bennett was in a predicament that would cause any other person to despair.\\n\"Losing this much blood... Not good.\"\\nBut Bennett did not stop. \"There's no reason to turn back,\" he thought.\\nSomehow, he just knew that all the agonizing misfortune he had suffered up till this point was for the sake of overcoming this precarious position.\\nBut at the end of his hellish journey, what he found at the end was — nothing at all.\\n\"Ha, returning empty-handed is... part of an adventure. I... don't mind...\"\\nAt last, his tightly-wound emotions came loose, allowing his many injuries to rob him of his consciousness, and he collapsed.\\nWhen he reawakened, he found that his wounds had been cauterized by a mysterious flame, stopping both the bleeding and the pain.\\nA jewel pulsed warmly in the palm of his hand, its rhythm in time with the heartbeat in his chest — the beating heart of an adventurer.\\nThis was not the mercy of the world, or that fate took pity on him. Rather, this was his \"final reward,\" one befitting a person with Bennett's burning passion."

            "Character Details\tThroughout its long history, Liyue has never had a lack of rumors and myths regarding all manner of evil spirits and demons. And regardless of the truth of such rumors, someone has to do something about them.\\nChongyun was born into a renowned family of exorcists, and has possessed a natural ability to drive away evil spirits from a young age due to his pure-yang spirit. His powers of exorcism are far beyond the norm: his mere presence is sufficient to scatter evil spirits. \\nHowever, this has proven to be an inconvenience for Chongyun himself, for though he has undertaken hundreds of successful exorcisms, he has never come face-to-face with a single ghost or demon.\\nChongyun believes in his heart that a true exorcist should exorcize evil with charms and swordsmanship. This natural ability that he has... is just not orthodox.\\nTherefore, he has dedicated himself to the study of exorcism techniques and martial arts, as well as seeking the haunts of evil spirits to prove himself an able and professional exorcist even without his unique physical condition.\\nYet, when will that condition stop being a stumbling block on his path to self-realization?",
            "Character Story 1\tWhen Chongyun first ventured out as an exorcist, there had been much talk of an evil spirit lurking inside Liyue Harbor.\\nThe victim of these hauntings was a woman from a family with a high enough stature to even have a word or two with the Liyue Qixing.\\nFrom a time she knew not when, her sleep began to be harassed by sounds that kept her awake, but every time she tried to follow the sound, it would suddenly shift behind her, and begin ringing again in her ears.\\nThis shock caused her unspeakable distress, and she even lost weight for loss of appetite.\\nHer wealth was enough to hire the best exorcists from all over, but no matter what they tried, they had to retreat empty-handed. And not only did the noises persist, they even grew in boldness.\\nIt was then, just when she had given up all hope, that Chongyun walked through her door.\\n\"I apologize for coming just now, it has been far too sunny lately... I heard that this place houses a very stubborn ghost. Please, leave it to me.\"\\nThen Chongyun brought a chair over, and sat upon it in the middle of the house for a time.\\nThat night, the strange sounds were no more.\\nThe wealthy woman finally had a good night's sleep, and she came running to Chongyun the next morning with an overabundance of gold and jewelry as a reward.\\nBut Chongyun, as was his wont, only accepted his usual fee of a few hundred Mora without an ounce of emotion on his face.\\nEver since that incident, Chongyun has found that his reputation precedes him for miles around. He has become beloved in Liyue for his \"style and character,\" and indeed scholars have given him this appellation: \"a heart of clear water, and a face of ice.\"",
            "Character Story 2\tHowever, calling his mannerisms and style \"frosty\" couldn't be farther from the truth.\\nDue to the abundance of yang energy in his constitution, he is constantly troubled by increased body temperature and sudden urges or impulses.\\nHe has tried everything to alleviate the issues both physically and psychologically.\\nHis methods include not drinking hot water, not eating hot or spicy food, wearing light clothes, not getting into arguments, keeping himself from being angered, staying indoors on sweltering days, and always bringing a parasol when on the job.\\nIn short, he attempted to stay away from everything that might aggravate his condition.\\nDespite all this, his yang energy did not subside a whit.\\nA little depressed, Chongyun began to wrestle with his own body. When he heard about an evil spirit in Dragonspine, he made for the peak wearing only a shirt.\\nThough it was hard enough to keep himself warm, he still felt this insufficient. Digging a hole in a frozen lake, he jumped in and soaked in the icy water while waiting for the evil spirit to show itself.\\nAfter staying in the lake for half a day, he finally caught a glimpse of his target.\\nHowever, after pursuing it down to the mountainside, he discovered it was only a snow rabbit that had been frightened off by his flying swords and floating charms.\\nThe fever that he ran afterward lasted far longer than it would in a normal person.",
            "Character Story 3\tChongyun's pure-yang spirit is not only a huge obstacle in his path as an exorcist, but a constant daily hassle.\\nHe must be extra careful to stay away from \"heaty\" things, to which he is very sensitive, or risk his yang energy and emotions going out of control.\\nChongyun's clan once held a celebration party at Wanmin Restaurant. And though he waited until all the dishes had gone cold, he did not expect the tender rice balls to be stuffed with Jueyun Chili.\\nAfter but a single bite... Chongyun had no recollection of what happened next.\\nHowever, according to the victim, chef Xiangling of Wanmin Restaurant, many unforgettable things happened.\\nChongyun first jumped onto the reception desk and shouted, \"Everything's on me tonight!\" — never mind that he did not actually have any money on him.\\nHe then began to chat with customers at other tables as if they were old pals, bragging to them of how incredible his clan's exorcist arts were, never forgetting to taste other people's dishes on the tables before he left.\\nLastly, he claimed to have sensed an evil spirit in Wanmin Restaurant. This he did not find, but he did slap a charm on Xiangling's forehead and chase her around with his sword.\\nAfterwards, Chongyun scrimped and saved for an entire month to pay Wanmin Restaurant back for the mess and any damages he might have caused; he also gave Xiangling an evil-warding talisman that he carved by hand.\\nBut Xiangling, for her part, didn't mind Chongyun's \"transgressions\" at all. Instead, she felt that the crazy Chongyun was the real Chongyun, without any personal walls up.",
            "Character Story 4\tChongyun has had the privilege of meeting a true friend in his long journey as an exorcist: Xingqiu.\\nIn contrast to the hard-working Chongyun, Xingqiu was naturally gifted, and had a more flexible way of looking at problems.\\nAfter learning about Chongyun's troubles, Xingqiu came up with a possible solution.\\n\"If you can't reduce the effects of your yang energy, what if you sought out an evil spirit that is immune to it?\"\\nThis was a eureka moment for Chongyun. Since then, Chongyun has no longer sought to alleviate his condition. Instead, he now tries to get Xingqiu to come with him to find such a spirit.\\n\"What? Sightings of the legendary Aoyin near the Sea of Clouds? Leave it to me!\"\\n\"The old house at Feiyun Slope has been taken over by an evil spirit? My bad. I'll attend to it right away.\"\\n\"A master exorcist is staying over at Wangshu Inn? I could learn a lot from him... Hmm, better go with a gift.\"\\nXingqiu usually just makes these \"leads\" up as he goes, and thanks to his \"advice,\" Chongyun often comes back empty-handed, blaming his bad luck.\\n\"I tried my best to look for it, and even spent quite a sum purchasing more intelligence on that evil spirit — but I wound up missing it by a hair anyway,\" Chongyun says, abashed.\\nIf Xingqiu has time to spare when such an occasion arises, he will encourage Chongyun, treat him to some new cold dishes he has found and then set off to get Chongyun's swindled money back.\\nA warm and reliable companion, indeed! — So Chongyun thinks at such moments. Who could he possibly trust, if not his fine friend Xingqiu?",
            "Character Story 5\tIn truth, Chongyun wishes that he could fit in more, but he is often forced to reject the invitations of others on account of his need to control his abundance of yang energy.\\nOf these practices, he finds one particularly incomprehensible: hot springs.\\nBathing and \"relaxing\" in steaming-hot water? Even the sound of that scares him a hundred times more than freezing in a lake on Dragonspine.\\nHowever, he has also heard everyone sing yearning praises of these hot springs, praising their comfort, and asserting that they become more so the hotter they are, and that one is filled with energy for a whole week afterward.\\nChongyun still doesn't know if this is true or if people are just teasing him.\\nAnd he would have dared to try it out, if not for the ever-present problem of his pure-yang spirit.\\nXingqiu once asked him this:\\n\"If you were able to master your yang energy and rid the world of all evil spirits someday...what would you do after that?\"\\nThis seemingly off-the-cuff remark troubled Chongyun deeply.\\nPerhaps he had indeed missed out on a lot in life on account of his condition.\\nBut he doesn't regret spending time. If one way of living doesn't work, he just needs to find himself another — and in any case, he already has his answer.\\nIf that day comes, well, he'll go to the hot springs then.",
            "Field Guide to Demons and Beasts\tThe tomes that Chongyun's family has passed down from generation to generation detail every evil spirit they have ever subdued.\\nFrom little critters to the monstrous demons found in tall tales of horror, their varieties are almost dazzling.\\nIt was one such terrifying story that inspired Chongyun's vow to rid the world of evil spirits.\\nBut as far as he is concerned, inheriting these books has... also proved inconvenient.\\nOther than textual descriptions, the books also contain illustrations of said evil spirits that carefully detail their unique characteristics — even if the artist may not have been the greatest talent.\\nBut Chongyun has never seen an evil spirit in his life. Unwilling to break with this artistic tradition, he was at a loss.\\nUltimately, he would attempt to use his imagination to draw some suitably strange images.\\n—Thus did the Field Guide to Demons and Beasts grow ever more exotic. Best not to think too deeply about that seven-winged, five-legged chicken-beast or that half-fish, half-hilichurl demon.",
            "Vision\t\"Those other exorcists at least have the courtesy to wave their swords or tack on some talismans. You just sat here for a while, and now you say you're done, and that I should pay you? Who are you trying to fool?\"\\nChongyun faced a great deal of suspicion when he first took up the role of an exorcist.\\nHe immediately faced one big hurdle: it was a lot easier to prove that \"evil spirits are present\" than not.\\nOf course he would seem a charlatan even compared to \"exorcists\" who just went through the motions.\\nWith all the ability in the world but no place to use it, looked on with suspicion, and needing to suppress any passionate impulses...\\nThose who eventually apologized to him were also few.\\nBut even so, Chongyun would not go with the flow, and use some fancy act to cover for his real method of conducting exorcism.\\nEven with his unique composition posing countless obstacles for him, Chongyun has never once considered giving up.\\nOne day, he will become the greatest exorcist in Liyue, control his abundance of yang energy, and rid the world of evil spirits.\\nPerhaps it was this resolve that earned him the gods' favor — that said, the Vision granted to Chongyun was one of \"Cryo\" rather than \"Pyro.\"\\nAs to which of his goals it was that the Vision responded to, that is also a mystery."

            "Character Details\tAs the city of ballads and wines, Mondstadt's alcohol industry is renowned all over Teyvat.\\nAs owner of the Dawn Winery, Diluc is essentially in charge of half the industry. This means he has a huge stream of revenue and an entire network of information, in the form of tavern patrons' gossip, right at his fingertips.\\nIn a way, he is the uncrowned king of Mondstadt.",
            "Character Story 1\tThe scent of wine always lingers in the air in Mondstadt.\\nIf one were to follow the scent to its source, one would invariably arrive at Diluc's Dawn Winery.\\nA wooden plaque proudly announces the winery’s name, and beneath it is written the winery's motto:\\n\"Shine True.\"\\nMost interpret this to mean that the wines are brewed for consistency of taste, with time-honored techniques and that same healthy dose of sunny optimism that the dawn brings.\\nMeanwhile, the more pragmatic Knights of Favonius are reminded of the long history of mutual support between the winery and the city.\\nThe winery holds festivities from time to time. These events are routinely attended by enthusiastic fathers, eager to introduce their wonderful daughters to the young and single winery master.\\nThis is all highly entertaining to the other guests, who watch on and comment, mockingly:\\n\"We'd much rather Master Diluc stays married to the winery, given how good this wine is!\"\\nDiluc deals impeccably with all situations, no matter who or what comes his way.\\nDiluc is a fine young gentleman in every conceivable respect.\\n",
            "Character Story 2\tDiluc avoids talking about the past.\\n\"If only Diluc were still a member of the Knights...\"\\nAfter a few drinks, senior knights will say words to this effect with a sigh.\\nThey refer to events from a long time ago, back when Diluc's father, Master Crepus, was still the owner of the winery. Master Crepus' wish was for his son to become the most esteemed knight of all and safeguard Mondstadt, the City of Freedom.\\nAs per his father’s wishes, Diluc trained rigorously to make himself worthy of the Ragnvindr name. Sure enough, he passed the Knights of Favonius' trials, swore the oath of protection to Mondstadt, and entered their ranks. Before long, he received an early promotion which saw him become the youngest-ever Cavalry Captain.\\nOver the course of his missions and patrols, the denizens of Mondstadt gradually came to know this young and passionate Cavalry Captain.\\nNo matter what the missions demanded from him, he always maintained his composure and his passion. No matter how big the challenge before him, his boundless courage always led him to the front line. The praise he received from his comrades and citizens spurred him on.\\nBut the words of praise he valued most of all were:\\n\"Good job. Now, that's my son.\"\\nHis father's words fueled the fire inside his heart and served as his greatest motivation.\\nHis faith was an unquenchable fire that burned strong and bright inside him.\\nDiluc was so young back then.",
            "Character Story 3\t\"Sometimes, life can change in an instant.\"\\nThe day that Crepus spoke these words to Diluc would turn out to be the latter's last as a Knight of Favonius.\\nFor on that day, a horrific monster attacked the transport fleet he and his father were traveling with.\\nThere was no time for Diluc to send for help. The monster was stronger than any foe the young Cavalry Captain had ever encountered, and overpowered him.\\nDiluc could never have anticipated the way this battle would end: His father, who had been denied admittance into the Knights and who was shunned by the gods, defeated the monster with an unknown evil power — before that same power backfired, mortally wounding Crepus himself. Crepus died shortly after in his son's arms.\\nWith a heavy heart, Diluc returned to the Knights' headquarters, only to receive an unthinkable order from Inspector Eroch: \"Conceal the truth.\"\\nEroch insisted that the incident must be portrayed as an unfortunate accident in order to maintain the reputation of the Knights of Favonius in the eyes of the public.\\nSuch was the sheer outrageousness of this request that Diluc did not think it was even worth trying to argue.\\nDiluc's father had once said to him that the world would never turn its back on the faithful.\\nBut now, the Knights of Favonius trampled on his faith like it was nothing. He couldn't help but wonder: What was his father's view on faith in his final moments?\\nDiluc resigned from the Knights that day and left everything behind, including his Vision.\\nHe swore to avenge his father's death, and to find the source of that occult power which had caused his father's demise.",
            "Character Story 4\tAfter Diluc resigned and discarded his Vision, he handed the running of the Dawn Winery over to the head housemaid and left Mondstadt altogether.\\nDiluc traveled all across the seven nations of Teyvat in search of the truth.\\nAll clues pointed toward a behemoth of an organization: The Fatui. He learned that they made counterfeit Visions in secret, calling them \"Delusions.\" A Delusion could amplify the power of its bearer to its extreme, but also carried the risk of backfiring. That was what had caused his father's death.\\nWas it possible that his father could have obtained such a sacrilegious item in order to do good?\\nDiluc knew he may never know the full truth, but that could never stop him from pursuing it.\\nLike an eagle scouring the wilderness, he set off on his hunt for the truth. Determination burned like fire in his heart, unfathomable enigmas and unending battles could not sway him from his course. He pressed on relentlessly, scarred but undeterred, like a fiery tornado burning through the dense fog of mystery.\\nThe Fatui's rulers, the Harbingers, monitored Diluc's progress from the shadows. The prowess with which he laid waste to numerous Fatui strongholds caught their attention and forced them to take action.\\nDiluc narrowly escaped death at the hands of the Harbingers thanks to a third-party observer from the north, who was part of a vast underground intelligence network. The observer claimed to have been watching Diluc for some time, and approved of his methods.\\nAfter his close encounter with death, Diluc took a long hard look at his past and the anger he had harbored for so long. Acknowledging his shortcomings, he decided to join the underground intelligence network.\\nJust like when he first joined the Knights of Favonius, Diluc committed himself fully to his work. His talents and skills saw him rise steadily through the ranks into the upper echelons of the network.\\nThe network was made up of volunteers, and many of its members had willingly given up their prior positions and reputations to join. Some had even abandoned their names.\\nCould working with these new comrades finally restore the faith he once clung to? The faith that had been all but destroyed in the events surrounding his father's death?",
            "Character Story 5\t\"Shine True.\" The background to this motto is hotly contested, but to Diluc it has one simple, clear meaning.\\n\"Evil cannot go unpunished.\\nNever settle for mediocrity. Never forget that the dawn will one day come.\"\\nDiluc's solitary sojourn lasted for three years.\\nFour years on, Diluc had returned to Mondstadt and taken over as head of the family winery, now a young man.\\nIn the space of these four years, Eroch had been purged from the Knights of Favonius after being shown to be a traitor, while Grand Master Varka had left on an expedition, leaving Master Jean to assume the role of Acting Grand Master.\\nThe return of the Dawn Winery's master should have been a momentous occasion for Mondstadt, but strangely it went completely unnoticed.\\nThe reason? Mondstadt's citizens were far too busy pondering the mysterious case of an unknown \"Guardian of Mondstadt.\"\\nAll that was known about the anonymous guardian was that the smell of burning would follow in his wake, and that a flash of red flames would reveal his silhouette for but a moment in the darkness of the night, before he disappeared in an instant.\\nThe bodies of monsters that had plagued Mondstadt for an age now lay dead in the wilderness... Mondstadt's most wanted thieves suddenly appeared bound and gagged, hanging from their feet in the statue plaza... All the Knights of Favonius were dispatched to reckon, once and for all, with the Abyss Mage behind countless crimes in the city, but they arrived only to discover that he had long since been killed...\\nAided by wine-fueled conversations, word of the mysterious guardian spread swiftly, and he came to be known as the \"Darknight Hero.\"\\nIn public, Diluc appeared to hold this hero in contempt, his face curling up in disgust every time the name was uttered.\\nElzer of the Mondstadt Wine Guild was one of the select few who was in the know, and once queried Diluc about this: Was his disapproval of the Darknight Hero just an act, intended to throw the knights off his trail and protect his anonymity?\\nBut Diluc simply frowned once more, and curtly replied: \"It's just a stupid name.\"",
            "Dawn Winery's Apple Cider\tDiluc may hold the whole wine industry in the palm of his hand, but he himself is not fond of wine.\\nAt Diluc's request, the Dawn Winery developed several alcohol-free beverages, a decision which was met with resounding approval from those in Mondstadt who could not drink alcohol but still wanted to partake in the drinking culture.\\nOne of those alcohol-free beverages is Mondstadt's apple cider vinegar, the success of which is on a par with dandelion wine in terms of monthly sales volumes.\\nSome think that Diluc must have such high standards when it comes to wine that he is never seen drinking the mediocre-quality beverages that are available to the public.\\nOthers think that drinking wine must surely remind him of his father, and that that is why he does not touch it.\\nWhen pressed about his drinking habits, he responds by saying that alcohol clouds his thoughts, and consuming it would impact his day-to-day work.\\nBut the thing that people don't understand is: What kind of day-to-day work does a winery master do, if it requires him to never touch a drop of alcohol?",
            "Vision\tCrepus had two regrets in life. One was never becoming a knight, and the other was never obtaining a Vision.\\nFor this reason, in the moment that Diluc received his Vision, he took it as a recognition by the gods of his and his father's shared ambition — finally, he could make his father proud.\\nJust a few years later, his father died on a dark and gloomy day. The hopes and dreams that burned bright in Diluc's Vision were extinguished in the torrential rain that fell on that night.\\nNo matter how upright and good-hearted a person may be, death will still come to them without warning.\\nIs this where the tale of justice ends? Just like that?\\nIt seemed to him that his Vision and his status as a knight were both equally ineffectual at enabling him to protect the things that he treasured most. It was time to discard them both, he decided.\\nWhen he recognized his own powerlessness, his Vision became but a burden, of no greater service than a Delusion.\\nEmpty titles were of no interest to him. He sought after ardent flames that would burn brighter than any other, and an unshakable resolve. Only a firm resolve can drive the truth-seeker forward, and only ardent flames can vanquish the ice that freezes the hand of justice.\\nOn the day that Diluc returned to Mondstadt, he took up his Vision once more. The events of his years away had purged him of his childish immaturity, and turned him into a hero ready to shoulder his father's will once more. Each night, from the shadows, he fought for Mondstadt.\\nHe did not discuss the past. But he did not deny the past, either.\\nTo the lost, perhaps a Vision is a beacon of light given by the gods to help them find the path forward.\\nBut to those with conviction, a Vision is simply an extension of their strength, a medium for channeling their willpower, a tribute to the experiences that have shaped them, and a testament to the story of their life so far."

            "Character Details\tWhenever a guest walks into the Cat's Tail, they will immediately glance in the direction of the bar.\\nBehind it often stands a girl with mildly-twitching cat ears, cocktail shaker in hand, and an unhappy look on her face.\\nThis is the mixologist Diona, ascendant star of Mondstadt's wine industry, and the greatest challenger to its traditional powerhouses.\\nHowever, she does not make these wonderful cocktails on purpose — indeed, quite the opposite.\\nHer mixing methods can seem a little \"inscrutable\" to an outsider. To herself, Diona tries nothing less than her hardest to ruin that hateful grog.\\nBut no matter the drink, it will turn out to be an unimaginably sumptuous brew so long as it passes through her hands.\\nThis is a \"blessing\" she has received, though that blessing is a huge headache for her.\\nFor this mixologist proclaims herself to be the \"Wine Industry Slayer,\" and her final objective is the utter destruction of Mondstadt's entire wine industry.",
            "Character Story 1\tComing to the Cat's Tail to serve as its bartender was really a prank on Diona's part, the first step in her master plan.\\nWhen patrons came in, they would \"enjoy\" her look of disgust as they got ready for the \"Diona Special\"...\\n\"Hmph. Here, drink this Sea-Salt Lizard, and kiss your life as an alcoholic goodbye...\"\\nSo she would say, thus ruining these boozehounds' appetites.\\nAnd yet...\\n\"*glug*... *glug*... Wow, I have never had such a wonderful drink! Can I get a refill, miss?\"\\n\"...You want a refill!?\"\\nTo this day, Diona has struggled with her unbroken record of mixing fine drinks. Unable to accept defeat, she has yet to give up on her dream of producing something truly disgusting.\\nHowever, the results are always the same, and the Cat's Tail remains a popular watering hole, with its pleased patrons singing praises unending of her skill.\\nAll poor Diona can do is puff up her cheeks, tears forming in her eyes as she grumbles:\\n\"Just you all wait!\"",
            "Character Story 2\tDiona's father, Draff, is the best hunter in Springvale.\\nWith a resolute face, honed hunting techniques, and calm judgment calls, he fully deserves to be the leader of the huntsmen of Springvale, and is an example to them all.\\nIn Diona's young mind, her father was her shining, perfect idol, the person she wanted to be.\\nAnd that was also why she cried her heart out the day the pedestal she had put her father upon abruptly shattered.\\n\"When he's drunk, he's like a wild boar rolling about in the mud!\" So she said, her eyes ringed red.\\nBut Diona was not ready to blame this on her father's terrible drinking habits, for how could such a great father have such faults?\\n\"It's the wine's fault! It bewitches people and makes them stupid!\"\\nThis is the source of Diona's hatred for alcohol, and the beginning of Cat's Tail's turn in fortunes.\\nThat said, Margaret, the owner of Cat's Tail, had never expected any of this to happen at all. Rather, she had a much simpler reason for hiring Diona.\\n\"What choice did I have? She's just too cute.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tMany patrons believed that Diona's feline ears and tail were part of her uniform as a bartender.\\nThis persisted until one day, when one particularly plastered fellow tugged her tail out of curiosity... only to find it unexpectedly warm and soft.\\nThat day, Diona turned the tavern upside-down.\\nThese feline features are the hallmarks of those with Kätzlein blood in their veins, and it is an exceedingly rare sight in Mondstadt.\\nOther than such aesthetic similarities, Diona and her father Draff also owe their prowess on the hunt to this ancient bloodline.\\nInfiltration, archery, climbing, and dodging... Diona required no teacher for such skills.\\n\"Ah, yes, and she also has a pair of eyes that can see well in the dark.\"\\n\"As for weaknesses... She bites when piqued, so please be careful.\"\\nThus did Dr. Edith write of Diona in her notes for \"Studies Into Bloodlines Strange and Unfamiliar.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tDiona's appearance did indeed have an impact on Mondstadt's alcohol industry.\\nThe Dawn Winery's long-held monopoly was broken overnight by this unexpected ambush from Cat's Tail, and the man put in charge of the winery's business, Elzer, found this unacceptable.\\nA calculating veteran of many industrial battles, Elzer considered poaching this key figure, never realizing that Diona considered the Dawn Winery a sort of \"final boss\" to be defeated in her quest.\\n\"This marvelous and bold method of preparation must be the secret of these flavors, yes?\"\\nDiona simply looked at the white-haired man who had just sat down in front of the bar, rank displeasure in her eyes.\\n\"Ah. Simply exquisite. I can just feel your incomparable passion and love for wine.\"\\nDiona's hand started to tremble as it held on to her cocktail shaker, and detecting the change at once with his sharp gaze, Elzer understood immediately.\\n\"If a brilliant bartender as yourself were to grace the Dawn Winery with your cooperation, we shall be able to bring Monsdtadt's alcohol industry to heretofore unseen heights!\"\\n...When Diluc questioned Elzer as to the story behind his bandaged hand later, he was uncharacteristically hesitant to say anything.\\n\"I... I was bitten by a cat.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tThere is a legend about a \"spring fairy\" that circulates in Diona's hometown.\\nThe fairy once saved a mother and son who had despaired beside a well, filling the barren hole with rushing waters that pooled and formed a spring. The child, deathly ill, was miraculously healed by those spring waters.\\nMany people came to catch a glimpse of these blessed waters, and built a settlement around it, and left it not thereafter. Over time, this gave rise to the small town known as Springvale.\\nNowadays, few are left who believe that this is any more than a mere legend, and some even dismiss it as myth-making for tourism's sake.\\nOnly little Diona believed in the existence of the spring fairy, and on nights when her father was in a deep stuporous sleep, she would speak to the moon reflected in the spring water's surface.\\nThese were her earnest feelings, innocent and wonderful — feelings worth answering.\\nThat was what the spring fairy believed.\\nSo, Diona would make a curious friend, a companion whom she could bare her feelings to and sometimes assuage her loneliness.\\nOn the night of Diona's seventh birthday, as the moonlight reflected off the spring and upon her face, she heard the soft voice of the spring fairy.\\n\"I will bless you, daughter of hunters, for your days ahead, and as a farewell. May your cup always run over with the sweet wine of celebration. May it always be refreshing as springs of ever-melting snow.\"\\nFrom that day on, the spring fairy would never appear before Diona again, and she left those memories behind, consigning them to her childhood dreams.\\nTill today, she has yet to realize that her troublesome constitution has anything at all to do with that dream.",
            "Cold Cocktail Shaker\tDiona's father Draff is also interested in mixing the occasional drink.\\nDiona's tail would wag from side to side of its own accord as she watched her father rocking the shaker back at forth at night.\\nBut young Diona also found that her father would wind up particularly drunk on such nights, becoming dead to the world before he could even finish her bed-time story.\\nThus, when Draff went out to hunt one day, she hid the shaker, squirreling it away in the deepest place under her bed.\\nUnexpectedly, her father didn't bother looking for the lost shaker at all. He simply brought a new one back the very next day.\\nWhen Diona went to Cat's Tail to try out for the role of bartender, Margaret noticed how the cocktail shaker Diona had with her looked wholly unsuited for her style.\\nEver skilled with handicraft, Margaret would give Diona a cocktail shaker equipped with a lovely cat's tail as an induction gift.\\n\"Now, this suits you far better,\" Margaret said with a satisfied nod.",
            "Vision\tDiona's antipathy towards alcohol is not \"hate\" per se. Instead, it can be considered a form of \"avarice.\"\\nShe wishes for her father to always be the man that she admires, and she treasures every moment that she spends with her family, unwilling to \"share\" her happiness with the wine.\\nThere was once a storm that lasted for three days, and for those three days, her father, who had been out hunting, did not return.\\nThe awful weather prevented the search parties sent by the Knights of Favonius from making much headway, and soon the dread of \"loss\" began to hang over Diona like a shroud.\\nIf she could not even stand to \"share,\" how could she bear having something utterly \"stolen\" from her?\\nShe burst out the door and into the tempest, and the waters that stood in her path were frozen by some power she did not recognize.\\nUsing her superlative tracking skills, she found her father under a broken gorge.\\nWith the help of the other hunters, she returned home with her father, and only once she realized that he would be fine did she finally smile again.\\n\"Do you... want me to mix you a drink? It'll numb the pain a little...\"\\nThat was probably the first time she ever mixed a drink in a normal fashion.\\n\"Ooh, it's so refreshing. It's wonderful! Hahaha—Ouch...\"\\nGetting to drink a cocktail that his daughter had made was probably a better anesthetic by far than the alcohol itself.\\nStill, Diona gaining power over Cryo did not help reconcile her to wine at all."

She was acting as a consultant for the merchant vessel, where she discovered something in the cargo — and then began to investigate, putting herself in grave danger. Had we arrived just a few minutes later, it's likely she wouldn't have been so fortunate.",
            "About Yanfei: Assessment\tWe've kept in touch ever since. I like how smart she is. She knows the rules, but she also knows how to be flexible and act according to the situation.

She does owe me a favor from last time, after all.",
            "More About Eula: I\tThe life of a Lawrence doesn't include much worth talking about... Basically, whatever you say, whatever you do, people will always despise you and treat you like a potential threat to society. It's nowhere near as bad as it used to be, though. Before I'd joined the Knights, good grief... I couldn't even buy groceries. Even Good Hunter and Mondstadt General Goods wouldn't take my money. I literally had to go out and hunt my own food and cook it over a campfire if I wanted to eat dinner.",
            "More About Eula: II\tPeople tell me that if I just spoke more softly, or was more polite, or acted more deferentially, others may find it easier to forgive me, but the only reason they think that way is because they've never been branded a pariah before. There is no easy path to redemption when you're a social pariah. I'm more inclined to stop tiptoeing around everyone all the time and just get out there and make them respect me the old-fashioned way! As in, we square off and if they win, I humbly accept my punishment, but if they lose, they must acquiesce to my demands... Such as... Well, I mean, if I want to buy a loaf of bread, take my darn money, for crying out loud!",
            "More About Eula: III\tThe Knights of Favonius are actually fairly reasonable, at the very least they reward merit and not social status. The reason they invited me to join their ranks is because I'd sparred with some of their crack troops and won through my own sheer skill. Being an insider in the organization will make getting revenge much easier, as it removes many of life's complications, so what's not to love?",
            "More About Eula: IV\tThe name Lawrence only became a social stigma after the clan fell from grace. It was once an honor to be called a Lawrence, but unfortunately, most people have forgotten about that part of history. The Grand Master says that I am performing rather well as a knight, and that if it's not enough to restore the honor of the Lawrence name, it's certainly a strong rebuttal against the one-sided opinions so many people throw around. I'm quite satisfied with that appraisal.",
            "More About Eula: V\tIf my family members refuse to change their corrupt ways, or worse, continue to cause active harm in Mondstadt... I should be the one to end them, along with the Lawrence name itself. For once, it'd be a family obligation I'd actually enjoy. And once the deed was done, I'd be free to pick any name I wanted. Or even let you pick one for me!",
            "Eula's Hobbies\tI'm into all sorts of cool things.

The most important thing is that they leave the people who like eating them with big smiles on their faces.",
            "Least Favorite Food\tI can't stand a rich broth. The flavor is too overpowering, it's so filling you can't train or fight afterward, and also, it doesn't really work as field rations... Simply put, broth and I are sworn enemies!",

            "Character Details\tEula's role within the Knights of Favonius is Captain of the Reconnaisance Company.\\nThe nature of her work means that she rarely sets foot in the city — she spends most of her time out in the wild, leading her team of scouts as they hunt down Abyss Order operatives and other monsters.\\nKnown as the Spindrift Knight, Eula wields her blade with consummate skill, but perhaps more importantly, she is well-versed in strategy and possesses great courage and excellent intuition. Grand Master Varka had nothing but the highest praise for her, even declaring once that she was the Dandelion Knight's equal on the battlefield.\\nOn the face of it, to have two such outstanding knights attending to the defense of Mondstadt in a single generation should be a cause for nothing but celebration. But dig a little deeper and there is a fundamental difference between Jean and Eula.\\nFor Eula is a descendant of the once-aristocratic Lawrence Clan. The blood that flows through her veins once flowed through those of Mondstadt's oppressors during one of the darkest periods of the city's history.\\nConsequently, Eula has been viewed with contempt by the citizens of Mondstadt since birth. The Lawrence name stands for a legacy of depravity and despotism that stains Mondstadt's past and scars the minds of its citizens even to this day.\\nSo, whenever Eula appears, old wounds resurface. People despise the aristocracy, and this does no favors for her reputation.\\nHowever, Eula is strong-willed and in spite of everything, she joined the Knights of Favonius and rose to the rank of Captain.\\nWhen people in the city voiced their reservations, she would respond head-on, claiming that her chosen course of action was out of a desire for \"vengeance.\" This matter-of-fact confession would alarm them all the more and has convinced everyone that she joined the Knights of Favonius only to serve as a mole for the former aristocracy.\\nOne person who sees things differently is Acting Grand Master Jean. In fact, she speaks rather fondly of Eula.\\n\"The rumors are all groundless. The Spindrift Knight is simply misunderstood, that's all.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tOn one hand, she is a descendant of the disgraced Lawrence Clan, the scion of a corrupt aristocracy. On the other, she is one of the top two sword fighters in Mondstadt.\\nIn other words, Eula is equal parts tainted blood and superior swordsmanship.\\nThere is no knowing when she might strike, nor what she might take from you... In the eyes of the citizens of Mondstadt, the Reconnaissance Captain is as unpredictable and tumultuous as the waves on a stormy sea.\\nEula responds with a cold haughtiness to accusations of this nature. To any who dare insinuate such things to her face, she replies, \"How dare you. Hmph, I will remember this.\"\\nShe is consumed by the desire to avenge herself, but is often on the move far away from the city. Sometimes upon her return to Mondstadt, she will brandish her greatsword and march straight to the Knights of Favonius headquarters.\\nOn one occasion, two fresh recruits standing guard on their first day on patrol watched this scene play out before their eyes. Alarmed and unsure how to respond, they ultimately did not dare to intervene. Instead, they simply watched on helplessly while Eula made a beeline for Master Jean's office.\\nMuch to their surprise, however, hours passed and no sound of a struggle was heard from within.\\nStill worried, the guards raised their concerns to Cavalry Captain Kaeya and Librarian Lisa as they were passing by.\\n\"The Reconnaissance Captain is back again? When you saw her, was it when she was marching towards Jean's office with her sword in hand, looking like she wanted to kill somebody?\"\\n\"Goodness, I must head there straight away. How can they have a tea break without me?\"\\nLisa hurried to Jean's office the moment she finished speaking. Meanwhile, Kaeya took the two guards outside and explained to them whilst trying to suppress a fit of the giggles:\\n\"We all know that the Acting Grand Master is a good judge of character, don't we? The Knights of Favonius are interested in a person's ability, not their family history. That's why she gives up her time to spar with the Reconnaissance Captain. In doing so, she can preserve the dignity of the Knights of Favonius while also providing a way of settling old grievances. Quite brilliant, don't you think?\"\\n\"Ohh... S—So that's how it is...\" \"...So 'tea break' is code for 'sparring'...?\"\\nThis kind of thing occurs almost on a monthly basis. But... if they're engaged in some sort of strange sparring ritual in there for the sake of settling old grievances and honing their fighting skills... How come they don't make a ton of noise?",
            "Character Story 2\tIn truth, Eula is nothing like the fearsome predator many imagine her to be. On the contrary, constantly being met with prejudice at every turn means she is often the victim.\\nAt one time, shops would refuse to sell her their goods, restaurants would put no care and attention into her orders, and the citizens on her patrol route would refuse to cooperate with her. So, Eula's work is fraught with difficulties.\\nWhen conflict arises, Eula fights back with a sternly worded threat to indicate that she will remember this grievance and make the offending party pay for it one day. It seems to work like a magic spell, because as soon as these words are uttered, the conflict ceases immediately without ever having to escalate to the level of an all-out confrontation.\\nFunnily enough, although people always have their guard up around Eula, she is a law-abiding citizen and has never harmed another Mondstadter in her life. She may come across as having a somewhat frosty demeanor, but she is entirely scrupulous in her speech and conduct.\\nNo one can ever find fault with her actions, and as people gradually get to know her, their morbid fear of her will dissipate. They will also start to realize her threats of vengeance are nothing more than a figure of speech that simply serve as a verbal warning in the moment.\\nEula, who may or may not be working to bring down the Knights of Favonius from the inside... Eula, who may or may not be an aristocrat mole... New recruits in the Knights of Favonius find her the most difficult person to deal with.\\nWhen Jean sends a new recruit to track down Eula in the wilds and deliver a new set of verbal orders, they always receive the same response: \"If you have to resort to tasking the descendant of your former oppressors with doing your work, then perhaps you are not as strong as I thought.\"\\nBut despite the antagonism in her words, she will complete her newly assigned tasks to perfection. The new recruit is invariably forced to admit that with her abilities, it is no wonder she was able to achieve a captaincy within just a few years of joining the Knights.\\nEveryone knows Eula is the frosty and antagonistic Spindrift Knight, the aristocrat who has a score to settle with the Knights of Favonius, the openly hostile and potentially dangerous individual... but is this really the truth of who she is?\\nOn the way back, the new recruit thinks back over Eula's every action.\\nWhat was that kind and resilient look I saw in her eyes when she wasn't looking at me? She seems to take her job seriously... So, surely she can be relied on after all?",
            "Character Story 3\tMondstadt is a city of freedom and happiness where even the descendants of a disgraced former ruling class can find true friends.\\nIf there is one person among the Mondstadt masses that Eula can trust, it is Outrider Amber.\\nEverybody loves Amber, so when she is around, shopkeepers will sell their wares to Eula at the normal price. If they're in an especially good mood, they may even say a few words to her during the process. It is at moments like this that Eula shows her most agreeable side.\\nBecause of this, and because Amber is just so nice, she'll often accompany Eula on trips out, or even run all her errands for her and deliver the goods straight to her home.\\nAmber is also the reason that the city folk end up hearing all about the Reconnaissance Captain's accomplishments out in the field. Each time Amber informs them of Eula's long list of achievements in battle, they can't help but let out a little gasp of surprise.\\nEarly one weekend morning, Amber stood behind a makeshift rostrum erected on a wooden crate and began announcing Eula's latest highlights: \"Recently, the Knights of Favonius Reconnaissance Captain saved the life of a woman at Dornman Port. After further investigation with this woman's close cooperation, she then proceeded to successfully capture all the Abyss Order operatives hiding in the vicinity of the port. The woman in question was a renowned legal expert from Liyue, and the Knights of Favonius have since received official correspondence from the Liyue Communications Office thanking the Reconnaissance Captain for her deeds...\"\\nWhether because Amber's persistent efforts have overcome historical prejudices or because Eula's achievements as a knight have quelled the long-standing fear in people's hearts, Eula's life has changed noticeably in recent years. Most of the city folk are no longer hostile towards her, and she has won over the members of the Knights of Favonius with her consistent results in the field.\\nAs for the members of the Reconnaissance Company under her leadership, they support her unconditionally. They always have her back when they head out to Mondstadt's outskirts to defend the peace of their nation.\\nOf course, the person who has always tirelessly rooted for Eula and is now the most delighted to see people's attitudes towards her change is Amber. They had been friends for a long time before Eula ever joined the Knights of Favonius, and as the granddaughter and beloved mentee of the first Outrider, Eula trusts her completely.",
            "Character Story 4\tOne might not expect this from her frosty attitude and sharp tongue, but Eula is a talented chef.\\nThe Reconnaissance Company today prides itself on having the best field rations in the Knights of Favonius. One staple of their inventory is a moon-shaped pie. Though a field ration, this wonderfully delicious and highly portable food is loved by all who try it.\\nThe Reconnaissance Company's designated chef once admitted that when developing this item, she was inspired by the captain's own baked goods. She extended the baking time to make the crust tougher and also substituted a few highly perishable ingredients with ones that last longer, reducing the cost while significantly prolonging the shelf life.\\nEven after such a major change to the recipe, the pie still tasted delicious. So, whenever the scouts are snacking, they can't help but wonder: If this is the field ration version, how delicious must the captain's original recipe taste?\\nThe answer to this question is buried deep within the pages of a dusty old book in the library. The Lawrence Clan may have been overthrown a long time ago, but they have never given up hope of one day rising again and reclaiming their place as the ruling class. So that they are always prepared for this monumental moment, their offspring are subjected to an educational regime so unbelievably harsh that it is considered borderline abusive.\\n\"Noble obligations\" must be performed to absolute perfection in every possible sense, and these obligations cover etiquette, ritual, and study as well as cooking and other domestic chores.\\nIn the eyes of the Lawrence Clan, \"Post-liberation Mondstadt lacks etiquette and taste. When the day comes for our clan to seize power once more, there shall be none who are qualified to be our servants. We must be cautious. We must never stoop to the level of the commoners and set foot in the quagmire of vulgarity.\"\\nThe Lawrence Clan's culinary arts teacher was particularly strict. If your dough was missing a half-spoonful of flour, or if your condiment was a few grains of salt short, or if you were two seconds late removing something from the oven, you were likely to be both scolded and disciplined. As far as Eula is concerned, the haute cuisine revered by the aristocrats is just another worthless consequence of people dogmatically following outdated rules.\\nFor this reason, the only kind of person who Eula will permit to try her own home baking is someone who she... respects...? No, that would be taking it too far. Rather, it should be someone who she grudgingly accepts \"will keep following me around and bothering me, seemingly undeterred by my warnings, despite having crossed me many times to date.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tBesides traditional etiquette, art is the second most highly prized asset to the aristocrats, known as the \"second soul.\"\\nThe \"Dance of Sacrifice\" — a ritual used by illustrious families to display their nobility — is thought of as the crystallized form of this soul, the prize gem in the ruler's scepter.\\nFolklore holds that Mondstadt's most illustrious clans jointly created the Dance of Sacrifice long before the aristocracy's reign of bloodshed began.\\nThe third act, which represents the Lawrence Clan, is a solo dance known as \"Flickering Candlelight.\" The most important part of the Dance of Sacrifice, it was performed by the most senior dancer, who was typically the eldest daughter of the clan.\\nThe Lawrence Clan would summon top dancers to serve as tutors for the eldest daughter and ensure it was performed to perfection. Bleeding toes were seen as a point of pride and a rite of passage for every dancer.\\nThis ancient ceremony was a continuous tradition for so long that even today, long after being expelled by the people of Mondstadt, the Lawrence Clan still honors it.\\nHowever, without the grand banquet and the gorgeous stage that once featured prominently in ceremonial performances, the Dance of Sacrifice is now far from the grandiose affair it once was. Furthermore, the stringent requirements regarding the dancer's posture and movements have also been relaxed due to the lack of tutors. In the end, the Lawrence Clan reluctantly decided that it could no longer be a mandatory part of the curriculum, and they relegated it to a artistic pastime.\\nOver time, the negative connotations and elitist expectations associated with this dance have faded away, and today it survives simply as a graceful dance.\\nAs the eldest daughter of the present-day Lawrence Clan, Eula found it to be a relaxing pastime in her youth and a welcome respite from her other grueling courses of study.\\nToday, Eula appears to have put her artistic pursuits behind her. At least, no one pictures dancing when they think of the Spindrift Knight.\\nNevertheless, a distinctly dance-like aesthetic can be observed in Eula's bladework, along with an elegant rhythm and musicality that are difficult to capture in words.\\nAs her greatsword rises and falls and sways to and fro, her distinctive and graceful poise is like that of a dancer under the moonlight: faraway, immaculate, and sublime.",
            "Glaciers and Waves\tEula is the bearer of the Lawrence family crest, the \"Glacial Seal.\" It is the highest martial symbol of the clan and represents the spirit of the Lawrence Clan in the early days of Mondstadt before their fall from grace: cold and unsullied, undaunted by any flame, composed and unshaken in all circumstances.\\nFew among their number have passed the clan's trials in a thousand years, and the hopes of the clan are passed from one seal-bearer to the next.\\nEula was still quite young when she underwent the trial but she passed with ease, taking up the seal in the process. Then she departed with that badge of honor in her possession and has contacted the clan little since.\\nHer icy sword is a manifestation of that strength, whipping about her like a frigid blizzard and driving her foes back.\\nYet sharp and bright as ice as she is, she has the nickname of \"Spindrift Knight,\" leading many who hear that name to assume that she manipulates Hydro instead.\\nThere is a story behind that misunderstanding — the story of a habit.\\nEula carries an exquisitely crafted bone whistle by her side at all times. Each time she blows it, the air will be filled with the vivid sound of ocean waves.\\nThe area her company is in charge of borders the sea, and to them, the sound of waves is an excellent tool for disturbing an enemy's judgment, or for deceiving less intelligent monsters into believing that a great wave is upon them, causing them to thusly flee.\\nEula has often emerged victorious even when pitting lesser numbers against greater forces in this way, and her unique combat tactics have earned her the moniker of \"Spindrift Knight.\"\\nOf course, a bone whistle is capable of imitating many other sounds, and Eula has her reasons for imitating the ocean waves.\\nIt would seem that \"Glacier Knight\" or something similar might suit her better.\\nBut perhaps Eula herself prefers the rolling waves to the unmoving ice...\\nWandering across the world, meeting and embracing reefs and sands alike with just the right intensity.\\nThe free and unbound ocean spray is more akin to her inclinations than a thing so keen and frozen in time.",
            "Vision\tWhat is the true nature of a \"grievance\"?\\nIs it dismal circumstance? An unfortunate past?\\nAnd what does \"vengeance\" mean?\\nIs it to obtain justice and satisfaction? Or to drive one's foes into a chasm of agony?\\nReclamation of the clan's past glories, winning the awe of the common folk, standing once more at the apex of rulership... These things are utterly unimportant to Eula.\\nShe never experienced that so-called humiliation — indeed, it was her clan that tormented her endlessly. She then attempted to free herself from these shackles, yet struggled to obtain the acknowledgment of others.\\nHer grievances and vengeance are but a habit, a signal, a shield.\\nWhat remarks she should just laugh off, what concepts she should bear in mind given her unique circumstances and position...\\nHow she should fight to settle the weighty issue of her bloodline once and for all...\\nIt was with such doubts and more that Eula came under the tutelage of a long-forgotten old Outrider. From him, she learned an open-mindedness and down-to-earth persistence that she had heretofore not possessed.\\nBefore grievance and vengeance, before clan and outsider, one must find \"oneself\" first.\\nOne's way of living, self-preservation, objects of perseverance...\\nThen call it \"grievance\" and name it \"vengeance\" — that will not change its essential strength and goodness.\\nIt would be Eula's very own gentle path of revenge... When she did at last find it, there it appeared before her — her Vision."

            "Character Details\tFischl is the Prinzessin der Verurteilung who arrived here after being exiled from the otherworld, \"Immernachtreich.\"\\nShe \"observes and weaves the threads of fate\" together with her talking night raven familiar, Oz.\\nOwing to reasons she cannot and Oz will not explain, Fischl now serves the Adventurers' Guild as an investigator.",
            "Character Story 1\tAs an investigator for the Adventurers' Guild, the single biggest advantage Fischl has over her peers is Oz.\\n\"Milady, please stop sending me out to spy on Stormterror. That chap could eat me for breakfast! Well, I'm so puny I probably wouldn't even get caught between his teeth, but... Anyway, I don't want to die!\"\\n\"Hmph! You are supposed to be my familiar. Not everyone gets to be the Prinzessin der Verurteilung's familiar, do you understand? Consider it your honor to dedicate your life to serving me!\"\\nFischl is able to see through Oz's eyes. Whenever she wants to, she possesses Oz and looks down upon the earth from the sky.\\nWhether she wants to inspect the flora on the Stormbearer Mountains or observe a disturbance in Wolvendom, through Oz she can see anything and everything.\\nThanks largely to her unique ability — and, to a lesser extent, to her own effort and peculiar personality — Fischl quickly went from the rookie investigator of the Adventurers' Guild to a respected rising star of the organization.\\nShe's certainly done well for herself. She only landed the coveted position of Investigator at age fourteen in the first place because her parents managed to persuade the guild master.\\nThen again, would they really have had to do much persuading? If she's the Prinzessin der Verurteilung... one can only assume that would make them the Kaiser und Kaiserin der Verurteilung.",
            "Character Story 2\tIt's said that there is currently a \"Fischl Dictionary\" in circulation among the adventurers.\\nNamely, a book that aims to translate Fischl's peculiar way of speaking into something more understandable.\\nFor example:\\n\"I hear... echoing in the abyss of time, the burning winds of the old, all of which shape the spire forgotten in the torrents of karma\" would translate into \"Stormterror's Lair\";\\n\"Servants of the Verurteilung name! As you have requested, prepare to receive the great wisdom of the prinzessin\" would be \"I'll look into that and let you know ASAP\";\\n\"Rejoice! O, ye servants who long for the blessing of the prinzessin; venture now deep into the battlefield with hearts of the tiger\" means that the initial investigative work has been completed;\\n\"All has been written in this tome of dark prophecies\" simply means that her journal has been updated with the latest reports.\\nHowever, the \"Fischl Dictionary\" is actually just an in-joke, not a real book.\\nThose who are familiar with Fischl concentrate on what she means to say, not the way in which she says it; she notices this and takes it as a sign of true respect.\\n\"Aha! So you do understand. Then fate does indeed bring kindred spirits together.\"\\nThose who manage to adopt her speech mannerisms when they respond to her will find she is both delighted and bashful, and praises their language-learning ability.\\n\"A prinzessin should always give praise where praise is due... Now, let us converse some more. Do not be mistaken; these are to be the foundations of the new world...\"",
            "Character Story 3\tOz and Princess Fischl are not only close friends but also servant and master, with a shared soul and fate.\\nTheir first encounter was mentioned in \"Flowers for Princess Fischl (I): End Time Zersetzung\"\\nWhen the lone pilgrimaging princess reached the kingdom of eternal twilight, the fate-resisting royals chose to deny everything in their desperation.\\nThey refused to recognize Fischl's noble stature and mission as the princess of the Immernachtreich; denied their 13,000-year lineage as a branch of the royal family; and forsook their own nobility and restraints as humans... devolving into clumsy and vicious beasts.\\nIn the palace of Twilight and amidst the teeth of the beasts, the princess shed her sacred blood on the ancient emblem.\\nAt the moment of her peril, the dark wings of the night ripped the trapped, wounded princess from her despair and took her under its wings.\\nFollowing the scent of her noble blood, Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, the King of Ravens came to the princess and pledged his eternal loyalty.",
            "Character Story 4\tThere is a story that goes as follows. A long time ago in a place far, far away, there was a tiny little girl.\\nThe girl's parents were busy adventurers. She spent most of her childhood in the library, traversing the countless universes that were contained in the pages of the library books.\\nShe became the ruler of the Immernachtreich, summoned Thundering Retribution as a royal princess, and formed a soul bond with a Raven...\\n...\\n\"███, what books did you read today?\" Her parents asked her on one of the rare occasions that they were home between adventures.\\nShe proceeded to tell them the story she had read from her favorite series.\\n\"...And then he said, Fischl von Luftschloss Narfidort, you are the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, my proud daughter. You shall never surrender your nobility and dreams.'\"\\n\"Oh, that's a lovely story. Since you like it so much, ███, how about I call you \"Fischl\" too?\" Her father smiled, put his hand on her head and repeated the words from the story to her.\\n\"Fischl, you are my wonderful princess and my proud daughter. You shall never surrender your nobility and dreams.\"\\nThese kind and loving words lit up her world.\\nHowever, the time with her busy parents was always fleeting.\\nUnable to fit in with her peers due to her obsession with fantasy novels, she often felt lonely and sad. At these times, she would remind herself:\\n\"I am Fischl, my daddy's wonderful princess. It's true, because Mommy and Daddy said so...\"\\n\"Never will I surrender my nobility and dreams, for they are... a princess' rite of passage.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tJust like in the universe of \"Flowers for Princess Fischl,\" entropy begot destruction.\\nIn other words: The girl who loved to dream grew up.\\nOn her fourteenth birthday, those of her peers who refused to accommodate her quirks belittled her once again.\\n\"This is but a minor setback for the noble princess. My parents will understand,\" she thought to herself.\\nFor if she knew one thing, it was that as a princess she could never surrender her nobility and dreams.\\nBut when she threw herself into her parents' arms in need of comfort, she was met instead with gentle words of exasperation.\\n\"███, you are fourteen years old now. It's fun to make-believe, but eventually you need to grow up and put your childish dreams behind you...\"\\nAnd with that, the same voice that had once lit up her world now tore it apart.\\nThat day at midnight, she hid herself in the library she knew so well. She had a strange feeling that she was being watched... Suddenly, she heard an otherworldly flapping of wings.\\nSure enough, she looked up and her red, swollen eyes met with those of a night raven from another world.\\nWhat transpired afterwards is another story...\\nFischl doesn't much like this story. Thinking about it causes her to feel suffocating pain and soul-devouring loneliness.\\nMaybe one day, this story will be written. But that would be ███'s story, not Fischl's.\\nFischl has but one identity: she's the Prinzessin.\\nAs long as she remembers this simple and perfect logic, with a little bit of nobility and a touch of kindness from others, nothing can ever hurt her.\\nThings are looking up for Prinzessin Fischl these days — not only does she have Oz, but she has finally met a traveler who, just like her, comes from a different world...",
            "Flowers for Princess Fischl: Phantasmagoria\tThe novel series \"Flowers for Princess Fischl\" is available as a collectible set.\\nDue the tiny numbers in circulation, it is a priceless commodity amongst loyal fans of the author.\\nBut no matter how elegant these works are aesthetically, their worldview remains incredibly bleak:\\nEvery good, bright and noble thing must eventually fall to inexorable entropic destruction, and the final destination of the universe is the realm-in-waiting of the Prinzessin, Immernachtreich.\\nThis is the fate of all worlds, of the universe, and all who live in it.\\nAnd the Prinzessin and her loyal companion, the \"Night-Severing Raven Oz,\" Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, are the World Beasts who will swallow all dreams.\\nAt the very end, at the end of karma itself, she will grant all the gathered souls her benediction, and use her Thundering Retribution to cleanse all that is ugly and wicked.\\nThe Prinzessin will then set her own heart ablaze, and the universe shall be born anew in its immortal light.\\nBut before all this can come to pass, the Prinzessin must first roam many universes, and see countless new sights.\\nThus it is perfectly within the spirit of the original work that the Prinzessin should be stuck as an investigator for the Adventurers' Guild in a slightly backward world. Just a little twist of fate, nothing more.\\nThe Prinzessin will come to understand someday that each moment of her life, no matter how insignificant their little twists could be, is to be treasured.\\nAfter all, the Prinzessin's very own Phantasmagoria is made out of ones such as these.",
            "Vision\tSo, is Oz just an imaginary friend who only exists as a figment of Fischl's subconscious?\\nOur story begins with the royal heirloom, Edelstein der Dunkelheit — that is to say, Fischl's Vision.\\nWhen her wish was acknowledged, the raven Oz and her Vision both appeared before her eyes.\\nThat night, at dinner, Oz got on most well with Fischl's parents:\\n\"Ah, mein Kaiser und Kaiserin der Verurteilung, forgive mine overstep, but the beans in your house are too delicious.\"\\n\"Oh, then please, help yourself. This is the first time little ███ has met a friend she can bring over for dinner since she turned fourteen. This is a special occasion.\"\\n\"W—What are you saying! I... One does not simply cavort with the plebeians!\"\\n—And that's what happened.\\nFor all intents and purposes, it seems that the Kaiser und Kaiserin der Verurteilung could both see Oz, and both believed Oz to be the Prinzessin's first friend.\\nAs for the \"Adventurer Who Bears the World's Curses,\" the \"Visitor From Outer Worlds\" and the \"Strange Fae-shaped Emergency Sustenance...\"\\nThey would become the Prinzessin's new friends, though that would happen even further in the future."

When lunch hour arrives, no matter where she is, she will simply curl up into a ball and fall asleep on the spot. Even the raucous dancing of hilichurls will fail to wake her.\\nThese habits were at first just a running joke within the Liyue Qixing.\\nBut once, after accompanying the then-Tianxuan to lunch outside the city, a well-fed Ganyu simply crawled into the nearest roadside haystack. She ended up being transported all the way to Dihua Marsh, awakening only after bumping her head during the unloading.\\nUnable to find Ganyu anywhere over the subsequent three hours, and knowing that she would not depart unannounced, the Tianxuan almost filed a missing person report.\\nAfter receiving a stern admonishment to \"only take afternoon naps where it's safe,\" Ganyu retorted:\\n\"Well... isn't everywhere in Liyue safe?\"\\nPerhaps, with the mixture of human and illuminated beast blood flowing through her veins, Ganyu's understanding of the world's affairs is a little different to that of most humans.",

For Ganyu, the difficulty of such a challenge is second only to finding a Flaming Flower atop Dragonspine.\\nBut she is not one to give up half-way through the ascent.\\nDuring the Archon War, she once choked a giant monster to death with ease after getting lodged in its throat when it tried to eat her, said monster having fatally underestimated quite how wide her waistline was.\\nFor Ganyu, avoiding any similarly embarrassing episodes in the future is an absolute must.",

            "Vision\tQilin are paragons of benevolence among the adepti, drinking only freshwater and eating only plants. Flies they will not hurt, and a bruised reed they will not break. They do not travel in groups, and no trap will hold them. They are leisurely yet composed, active but reserved — a gentle and elegant race. Yet when a wicked beast from the sea arose and threatened the land beneath their feet, they did not stand idle or choose peace when there was none. Three thousand years ago, Ganyu answered the call of Morax the God of Geo, aiding him in the Archon Wars. And when the war was over, she chose to stay in Liyue and help the humans build a new polity there. The first Liyue Qixing would need support, and she took this task up as a matter of course, becoming their secretary. The moment she made that decision, a Vision appeared at her hip, granting her power to resonate with the world to a degree beyond her natural abilities. Whether she would grow strong enough to no longer need it, or whether she would use it as a last resort in Liyue's defense... Regardless, she chose to serve as the bridge between adepti and humans. Her Vision, then, was proof and witness of her new duty."

            "Character Details\tThe 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, a young lady managing the parlor's operations. Despite her position, she's an amiable person who puts on no airs.\\nHer antics are as plentiful as the sand on Yaoguang Shoal. She never ceases to shock people with her countless bizarre ideas.\\nHu Tao may seem like all play and no work, spending every free moment on leisure and being widely considered a laissez-faire business owner.\\nIt is only during funeral ceremonies, when she personally leads her undertakers through lamp-lit alleys, that she shows her dignified and solemn side.",
            "Character Story 1\tFuneral ceremonies allow mortals to leave this world with dignity.\\n And Liyue's Wangsheng Funeral Parlor is said to be painting the last strokes on the scrolls of people's lives in the most respectful way.\\nTraditional funerals include multiple steps such as holding a wake, burial, putting up a memorial plaque... All of which are subject to strict rules.\\nRegardless of their social standing and level of wealth, all who depart deserve a ceremony that would do them honor. This is the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's client service philosophy.\\nOne would think that such a reputable organization ought to be led only by an individual of utmost learning and sagacity.\\nYet the heavy mantle of the 77th Director has fallen on the shoulders of a young lady like Hu Tao.\\nShe has got quite a reputation in Liyue. Whenever someone mentions Hu Tao, their neighbors find it extremely hard to navigate the conversation.\\nAlthough she is widely praised for her wit and shrewdness, her eccentric notions are not as welcome, as she often lets her imagination run wild.\\nAs a three-year-old, she would read through volumes of classic texts while doing handstands. At six, she would cut classes and fall asleep in coffins. When she was eight, she started living in the parlor and learning the etiquette of funeral ceremonies...\\nOne would never use the word \"measured\" to describe her behavior.\\nDuring her teenage years, Hu Tao was tasked with conducting a funeral ceremony for the first time.\\nThe parlor's undertakers and consultants were anticipating her debut with their stomachs in knots as if they were suspended over the peaks of Jueyun Karst.",
            "Character Story 2\tFortunately, Hu Tao treats the parlor's operations with the utmost importance and is always looking to grow her business.\\n\"At the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, the living give us Mora to see the dead on their way. We have a responsibility to both parties, so we gotta make sure both sides are happy.\"\\nWhen it comes to the parlor's rules, Hu Tao knows them all like the back of her hand.\\nEach day when the parlor closes its doors, Hu Tao invites consultants from different walks of life to pass their teachings on to the undertakers.\\n\"The funeral tradition is like science. It cannot be performed based on impressions and personal habits.\"\\nOf all the lecturers, Zhongli is the most revered one. As such, his lessons have proven to be the most effective in cultivating the competence of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's undertakers.\\nDespite often being teased by Hu Tao due to his old-fashioned style, he is also the person that she trusts the most.\\nApart from that, Hu Tao always instructs her undertakers to respect their clients' wishes and not insist on any particular form of funeral.\\n\"Some clients want nothing more than a peaceful ceremony, some opt for a more lively style of event. There are also wealthier clients who would request a funeral arrangement of the most pompous kind. The services we provide have to be tailor-made according to the clients' needs.\"\\nEver since Hu Tao took over, the parlor's operations have been solid and reliable, with ceremonies conducted so tactfully that quite a few superstitious people in Liyue have changed their attitudes towards funerals.\\nEven so, Hu Tao still has a tendency to wander off, disappearing as soon as her undertakers are busy listening to lectures.\\nThe hobbies and interests of this young director are just as eccentric as her personality, and yet it is difficult to say with certainty if those activities are of a purely leisurely nature.\\nHu Tao's shadow can be seen in the moonlit docks or at the highest, most precarious viewpoints in the mountains, where she's likely to take in the scenery and shape her thoughts into beautiful poetry.\\nShe loves to roam freely at night, looking for inspiration. When it strikes her, no matter where she is, she cannot help but compose a poem on the spot.\\nIf they are particularly lucky, the traveling merchants taking respite around the Huaguang Stone Forest can spot a mysterious girl keeping herself amused in solitude.\\nHu Tao can play a four-player card game accompanied by no one for hours on end.\\nThat said, the joys of engaging in such activities remain a mystery to all but Hu Tao herself.",
            "Character Story 3\tThe Ministry of Civil Affairs is guarded by two life-like stone lions, a symbol of power and authority.\\nHowever, Hu Tao, who happened to be passing by the ministry building one day, saw them in a different light. At first, she examined the lions with a thoughtful look, but soon enough, her pensive face gave way to a wide smile, as she slapped them on the fore-paws.\\nFrom that moment on, Hu Tao often visited and petted the stone statues. Not only would she talk to them, but also give them pet names — Whiskers for the one on the left and Mittens for the one on the right.\\nOn occasion, she would even bring a bucket of water and a big brush to bathe them, each move so careful and deliberate that one might think that they were her actual pets.\\nAs it happened, another feline, a living and breathing calico cat, could be found enjoying the local delicacies in front of Xinyue Kiosk, not too far from the ministry building. One day, some city folk came to play with the restaurant's favorite, providing an interesting foil for Hu Tao's peculiarities. Met with befuddled gazes of the bystanders, Hu Tao showed unwavering confidence.\\n\"Sure, your kitty's cute, but the same can be said about my Whiskers and Mittens. Their fur might be harder, but they're still just as fluffy! Any animal that brings people joy may become a pet. And when it comes to majestic looks, your little fur-ball simply can't measure up to my lions!\"\\nSuffice to say that this explanation was met with even greater consternation from the onlookers.\\nYet the group of people shocked the most and most often by Hu Tao's antics were the ministry guards. Soft footsteps could often be heard in front of the building at around midnight. Initially, the guards suspected that it had been a thief preparing to rob officials. To their unceasing surprise, it would turn out to just be a young lady playing with the stone lions.\\nThe guards were faced with an even bigger conundrum when, once everyone had reluctantly got used to her presence, Hu Tao discontinued her visits.\\nThat meant that the responsibility for cleaning the statues fell on the guards' shoulders once again.\\nSubsequently, they decided to keep guard by the lions for many days, anticipating Hu Tao's return. Once they finally had the opportunity to ask her why she would not visit anymore, they received the most absurd of answers.\\n\"Whiskers and Mittens are adults now and can take care of themselves! Excuse me, I'm running late for my heart-to-heart with a Statue of the Seven regarding the meaning of life!\"",
            "Character Story 4\tNot long after her initial meeting with the little zombie, Hu Tao decided that, as her self-proclaimed true friend, she should grant Qiqi eternal peace.\\nHu Tao would go on to kidnap Qiqi several times following much deliberation in every instance, including calculating the most auspicious time for the ceremony, aiming to follow the standard procedure of cremation, after which she would place Qiqi in a tomb on the outskirts of the city.\\nIn fact, she would have succeeded already if not for Baizhu's timely interventions.\\nEach time the Bubu Pharmacy's owner managed to catch up with them, Hu Tao had already had Qiqi packed in a bag, with only her head sticking out, staring in utter confusion as Hu Tao was vigorously digging a hole for the pyre.\\nAfterwards, Hu Tao sent Qiqi an apology letter, in which she expressed deep regret that she had not been able to lay Qiqi to rest fast enough.\\nIn Hu Tao's eyes, Qiqi passed away a long time ago, but has been trapped in this world and cannot free herself of her eternal suffering.\\nBaizhu, for his part, had grown ever more relentless in his pursuit of eternal life after meeting Qiqi. This act of defiance against the cycle of life and death was unacceptable to Hu Tao.\\nShe wanted to bury Qiqi not only out of consideration for her friend but also to restore the natural order.\\nBut Qiqi could not disagree more, as she was afraid of death and disliked Hu Tao for her attempts.\\nBecause the struggle between Hu Tao and her had been going on for so long, Qiqi has experienced a breakthrough. She has started to remember places where she might hide to avoid being captured by Hu Tao.\\nPerhaps it was due to those desperate survival efforts that Hu Tao decided to do something unusual and dig deeper into Qiqi's past.\\nThe story of her accident and the mystery of the adepti... That series of coincidences filled Hu Tao's heart with hesitation.\\nSince Qiqi's will to live is so strong, she should not be forced to move on. Given the circumstances, she could only be treated as a rare exception that eludes the natural laws.\\nEver since, Hu Tao's attitude towards Qiqi has changed drastically, to the point that she would pamper her.\\nUnfortunately, the damage has been done and Hu Tao has become Qiqi's bugbear. The little zombie may need several years more to let go of her grievances.",
            "Character Story 5\tHu Tao is not, in fact, best known for her role as Director, but for her other great accomplishment: the creation of poetry.\\nShe dubs herself the \"versemonger of the darkest alleys,\" and free verse flows forth untamed from her mouth whenever she has free time to be out on the streets.\\nThe \"Hilitune\" is Hu Tao's most famous work, well-loved not only by the people of the harbor, but ever on the lips of children as far as Qingce Village as well.\\nHobbyists and critics alike were greatly surprised by the simple but profound originality of the \"Hilitune\" and its creation, and went to Wanwen Bookhouse in droves to search for the works of this great poet. Unfortunately, Hu Tao's anthologies, named \"Fiddlesticks\" and \"Of Common Lives\" respectively, have yet to be published.\\nXingqiu, ever immersed in books, also wanted to meet this strange person, and so chose an auspicious date to visit, bringing a gift with him.\\nThe two hit it off immediately, and they exchanged pointers and impromptu poetry in Wangsheng's main hall — and when faced with the poetry of Xingqiu's traditional, artistic bent, Hu Tao could always return in kind with some strange and marvelous verse.\\nAnd there was meaning in the chaos, indeed, a rhythm to the bizarre that anyone could perceive, and it was catchy, too.\\nThus did she \"beat the old master with untrained fists,\" leaving Xingqiu at a loss for words.\\nAt length, the poetic spar ended amiably, and they have been friends ever since, reading and composing poetry with one another when they have the time to meet.\\nOver time, Chongyun, too, was pulled in to serve as an umpire, their laughter filling the streets.\\nThe poems born from these sessions would also be recorded by bystanders.\\nIf ever you should hear a pair of matched verses, one strict and the other playful, you are most likely to have heard one created jointly by Hu Tao and Xingqiu.",
            "Harmony Hexagram Hat\tThis hat is somewhat on the hard side, and the insignia of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor adorns its front.\\nIt is said that this hat was passed from the 75th Director to Hu Tao. However, that director was large, musclebound, and had a head at least two sizes larger than hers.\\nUltimately, Hu Tao had to spend an entire day and night to modify the hat with her own hands such that its dimensions would fit hers. When she meets others, she tells them: this hat is magical, upholding good and repelling evil, and is a bringer of peace!\\nThe undertakers laugh and leave it at that, but the 77th Director clearly does treasure that hat.\\nNo matter the rain or storm, or if Hu Tao returns late covered in muck, that hat will remain spotless and clean.\\nThe plum blossom that adorns the side of the hat is plucked from a plum tree that Hu Tao planted and grew herself.\\nIts creation process is as follows: pluck and air-dry, then paint, lacquer, and outline carefully before sun-drying for three days and voila — a beautiful accessory, soft to the touch and bearing a delicate fragrance.",
            "Vision\tThis tale should begin with the funeral of Hu Tao's grandfather.\\nTen days before the funeral itself, Old Hu had passed away following a bout of illness. For its 75th Director, Wangsheng Funeral Parlor held a grand funeral, in accordance with the last wishes of the old man himself, to be conducted by Hu Tao.\\nOnly thirteen at the time, Hu Tao, who would later go on to become the Director in turn, made all the arrangements herself to the highest standard, greatly impressing the undertakers.\\nAfter the funeral, the thirteen-year-old Hu Tao grabbed her traveler's bag and crept out alone in the dead of night. In her bag were only a few rations, some water, and a means to create some light. She was headed to a mysterious and seldom-seen frontier.\\nHeading straight from Wuwang Hill, one may arrive at the \"border.\" It is the line that separates life and death, the secrets of which have been managed by Wangsheng Funeral Parlor for generations. According to legend, it is a place where the souls of past relatives and the spirits of those with unfulfilled aspirations linger. For Hu Tao, this journey was a chance to see her grandfather once more before he departed forever.\\nFor two days she journeyed unceasingly before finally arriving at her destination, yet was unable to locate her grandfather upon arrival. Between the innumerable spirits she walked, but not one of them resembled the old man.\\nShe stayed there the whole day before falling asleep in exhaustion, awakening to a night sky and heavy dew. Around her were gathered a few lone spirits, clapping and laughing:\\n\"Silly girl, why would Old Hu be here of all places? What were you thinking, looking for your relatives here?\"\\nNot one to be swayed so easily, Hu Tao continued to wait, day after day. Her rations gradually disappeared and her water supplies drained away, but her grandfather did not appear. In the end, it was a little old woman who came to her.\\nShe laid eyes on the exhausted Hu Tao and smiled as she spoke: \"Look at your stubbornness, you're exactly like Old Hu. It's a shame, but none of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor Directors would ever linger here. You come from a family of plain speakers, so let me return the favor... Go back. Go back to where you came from.\"\\nThe old woman bid farewell to Hu Tao, before passing over the border and into the distance. Hu Tao watched as the figure of the mysterious woman grew smaller and disappeared, as a sense of doubt tinged with relief manifested itself.\\nAt last she came to the conclusion: her grandfather's absence was due to him having passed over the border as soon as he'd arrived, to the place where he was bound. He had been open and honest in life, leaving behind no regrets, so was it right for his departure to be framed in regretful terms?\\nWith a smile, she set forth on the return journey.\\nThe faraway moon had been casting a thin light on the way over but had now been replaced by the bright light of dawn. As she walked, Hu Tao thought of a saying that her grandfather had often quoted: \"Live in life, die in death. Follow your heart, do what you can.\"\\nIt was noon when Hu Tao arrived home. She climbed over the wall into the rear courtyard, went straight to her room, and unpacked her travel bag.\\nWith her food and water long gone, and the rest of her belongings unpacked, the bag she had taken for empty instead contained a colorful Vision. Just when had it arrived?\\nAs one of the few living that had dared to visit the border, perhaps Hu Tao's actions had moved some unknown god.\\nPerhaps this then constituted a heavenly gift... the ultimate recognition of her strength."

            "Character Details\tThe Knights of Favonius are the protectors of Mondstadt, the swords and shields of the city.\\nIn addition to keeping the city and the surrounding travel routes safe from the threat of wild monsters, the Knights' most important responsibility is maintaining order among Mondstadt's inhabitants.\\nMondstadt is the City of Freedom, but unchecked freedom without any kind of rules only invites chaos and anxiety.\\nJean's understanding of this is the reason she remains diligent at all times, holding herself to impeccable standards.\\nHowever, she often finds that she exhausts her monthly quota of coffee within the first few days of the month as a result.",
            "Character Story 1\tThe Gunnhildr Clan is the oldest family of knights in Mondstadt, dating back to even before the very first epic was written.\\nHowever, this long and proud lineage can also be a burden. Jean was raised by her mother to be the successor to the Gunnhildr Clan.\\nShe was trained in all the things a knight must know and all the qualities they must exhibit, from discipline, etiquette and conduct, to knowledge of history and ballads, as well as maintaining peak swordsmanship and physical fitness. Only by upholding this standard can Jean carry the mantle of the Gunnhildr Clan, whose motto is: \"For Mondstadt, as always.\"\\nSome time ago, there was a joke commonly told in Mondstadt's taverns: A Gunnhildr learns to say \"For Mondstadt, as always\" before learning to say \"Mommy.\"\\nAs a child, Jean once lifted her head up from the book she was reading, \"Breeze Amidst the Forest - Ballad Selection,\" and saw the other children her age happily playing with pinwheels outside the window. The young Jean knew in that moment what her family motto meant to her.\\nNow, when she lifts her head up from her piles of paperwork and sees the next generation of children doing the same thing, Acting Grand Master Jean has no regrets about her years of service to that motto.\\n\"You have to give your all to do the right thing. Always.\"",
            "Character Story 2\t\"Master Jean is so reliable.\"\\n\"If you ever run into trouble, seek Jean. She'll know what to do.\"\\nThe denizens of Mondstadt, civilians and knights alike, all rely on Jean.\\nIf someone needs help for the right reasons, Jean does not hesitate to render assistance.\\nBe it a quarrel down at the market, a relationship issue...\\nNo matter how unrelated it may be to a knight's job... Jean gladly lends a hand whenever she can.\\n\"The chance to help someone in need is reason enough for a knight.\"\\nTo her, her knightly duty takes priority over her role as Acting Grand Master. She believes helping others herself is the best way to assist.\\nShe holds her fellow knights to the same standard.\\nLisa the Librarian once suggested that Jean take a break and \"enjoy some afternoon tea, as is befitting of a lady.\"\\nHowever, to Jean, doing that which is befitting of a knight takes priority over doing that which is befitting of a lady.\\n\"Jean is so reliable.\"\\nSuch is the reputation Jean enjoys in Mondstadt.\\nHer only gripe is that there are not enough hours in the day. She could never help all of those in need, even by forgoing sleep.\\nThe dedication and commitment required to become someone so reliable is unimaginable.",
            "Character Story 3\tGiven everything Jean has brought to her role as Acting Grand Master, people sometimes forget that there is, in fact, a Grand Master who is her superior.\\nThis does not bother her in any way, though. Her role and title within the Knights of Favonius do not affect her work ethic in the slightest.\\nHer passion, honesty, and meticulousness come from two things.\\nOne is her education and training, which instilled in her a chivalrous spirit from a young age.\\nThe other is the devoted teachings of Varka, the free-spirited Knight of Boreas and Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius, currently dispatched on a crusade.\\nThe effect the relaxed and unruly Knight of Boreas Varka has had on Jean's growth has been great.\\n\"Grand Master, please take your job seriously. All of Mondstadt looks up to you.\"\\n\"Well, you are my second-in-command, so helping me out is part of your job description. This way, I can focus on the really important things, wouldn't you agree?\"\\n\"...\"\\nHe is the knight of new frontiers and legendary conquests, while she is the knight of maintaining peace and freedom.\\nJean does not resent Varka; perhaps there is wisdom in his conduct. However, what Varka leaves undone falls on her shoulders, and it is then down to her to do the right thing.\\nHalf a year ago, Varka led the elite knights of Favonius on yet another expedition away from Mondstadt.\\nAn expedition — how typical of Varka's character.\\n\"I'll leave things here to you. I mean, you've basically been doing my job for years now, anyway.\"\\n\"Leave it to me, Grand Master.\"\\nAfter seeing the Grand Master off, Jean sat by the window and thought to herself:\\nUpon your return, I will show you a kinder, more prosperous, and more peaceful Mondstadt.",
            "Character Story 4\tThe great tree at Windrise is where the first Dandelion Knight came to the end of her journey.\\nShe was Vennessa, the founder of the Knights of Favonius and the restorer of Mondstadt.\\nShe bade farewell to the city she had vowed to protect, leaving behind her legend and a single sapling.\\nAfter centuries of basking in the bliss of the thousand winds, this sapling grew into a towering tree.\\nJean was conferred the title of \"Dandelion Knight\" at the age of fifteen.\\nThe Dandelion Knight is also known as Lionfang Knight. Passed down through generations of knights, the title is bestowed upon only the most distinguished.\\nOn the day she received the title, Jean excused herself from the celebrations that followed the conferment ceremony. As if following in the footsteps of her childhood hero, she went and stood before the great tree.\\nThe title of Dandelion Knight symbolizes Vennessa's legacy of resistance and benevolence. So how, Jean thought, could one such as herself be worthy of this honorable title?\\nMore than a millennium had passed since Mondstadt's restoration. Did she really have what it would take to continue to protect this ancient and proud land of freedom?\\nBeneath her outwardly mature visage lay the heart of a young girl, who had only just received the title and remained wholly unprepared for the task that lay before her.\\nThe wind blew from far away, and she felt it flow within her as it gently whisked away her doubts and worries, leaving her with an unwavering determination:\\nFor Mondstadt, as always.\\nTo become a warrior as kind and as determined as Vennessa, and to fight for her people and for freedom... Yes, this was the true meaning of her simple family motto.\\nTo this day, whenever Jean feels weary or feels herself beginning to waver, she comes and stands before this tree and lets the wind console her once more. It carries away her fatigue, so that she may once more have the strength to carry on.\\nThe great tree at Windrise marked the end of the first Lionfang Knight's journey.\\nSo too does it symbolize the beginning of Jean's.",
            "Character Story 5\tMaster Jean has a secret.\\nThe Gunnhildr Clan is a venerable knightly house. This prideful blood comes from Jean's mother, Frederica.\\nJean's father on the other hand is Seamus Pegg, an adventurer famed throughout the continent. When he came to Mondstadt, he dusted off his past self and started anew with the Church of Favonius, and ascended to high office within it, becoming known as the Cardinal of Daybreak.\\nThe two lovers eventually parted ways. Young Jean, holding her mother's hand, would watch the silhouettes of her father and her sister, Barbara, grow ever more distant.\\nLater, Barbara would follow in her father's footsteps and join the Church of Favonius, becoming a deaconess much beloved by the people.\\nJean has always wanted to get closer to her younger sister by blood, but cannot bring herself to say anything when faced with Barbara's evasive eyes.\\nPerhaps this all-too-similar awkwardness is a sign that the sentiment is shared.\\nMaster Jean has yet another secret.\\nNo matter how many times she has read the historical classics, despite her title of Dandelion Knight, and though she has become the Acting Grand Master whom everyone relies on...\\nJean still loves romance novels.\\nThis is not for the years as a young girl that she missed amid her training and duties, or due to the rift that formed in her parents' marriage.\\nJean simply yearns for the mutual attraction spoken of in such stories, for those emotions as subtle and fragile as spider-silk.\\nAs a knight, she must put Mondstadt and the Knights of Favonius first.\\nBut...\\n\"If I too could...\"\\nIn her office, deep at night, Jean once again finishes reading \"Vera's Melancholy.\"\\n\"If I have the time, it should be fine to go to Cape Oath, just before daybreak... right?\"\\nLowering her head, Jean peeks out her window at the glittering stars above.",
            "Jean's Daily Schedule - Ver. XVII\tThis schedule is accurate down to the minute.\\nFrom a morning run with Amber followed a breakfast trip with Lisa on the way, to doing her own laundry by hand and settling her own change of clothes at night — all things great and small pack Jean's schedule rather tightly.\\nEvery completed item is ticked off, while ones delayed due to external factors list the detailed whys and wherefores.\\nNext to the item \"Mondstadt Public Facilities Review\" — delayed due to a bout of illness — is written the following \"completed at 3 am, end-of-month book purchase award is canceled.\"\\nJean sometimes thinks that inspiration for this schedule may have been the training program her mother drew up for her ten years ago.",
            "Vision\tIf one were to go by skill alone, Jean has long become one of the best swordsmen in Mondstadt.\\nBut in Jean's heart, she would rather be a shield that defends freedom and song than a sword that cuts through corruption and darkness.\\n\"Protecting\" has always been a tougher task than \"destroying.\"\\nAround the time when she was promoted from Captain of her squad to Master of the Knights, a huge challenge stood before her. From without, the Fatui exerted diplomatic pressure, and from within, there were traitors — comrades of the former Inspector. Regrouping and finding a way to break through was no easy task.\\nBut Jean was able to fend off the external pressure with one hand, and lead the Knights to smash the many plots of the Abyss Order with the other, re-establishing the authority of the Knights of Favonius.\\nJean will never forget the moment she received her Vision. At that moment, all seemed to grow quiet as she felt the breeze flow through her hand. The world seemed to fade away, save for the time-honored motto of the house of Gunnhildr:\\n\"For Mondstadt, as always.\""

            "Character Details\tMost people who meet Kaedehara Kazuha for the first time might be inclined to assume that he is just a trainee sailor with the Crux Fleet.\\nAfter all, he is a gentle soul who enjoys reciting poetry when idle, and who speaks to everyone in a leisurely manner. Who could tell that he is a wanted man throughout Inazuma?\\nEven Beidou, ever the good judge of character, could not tell that Kazuha could wield a sword with the skill of a seasoned warrior when she first decided to take him in.\\nWho knows if it was the storms of life that smoothed out his rough edges, or if his natural restraint has kept his edge sheathed.",
            "Character Story 1\tThe Crux, an armed fleet from Liyue, spends much of the year on the high seas, and its sailors are quite used to the vagaries of life in other nations. So they were more curious than surprised when an outlander began serving as a sailor on their flagship, the Alcor.\\nThe sailor in question was picked up when the Alcor docked at the Inazuman port of Ritou.\\nBeidou had made friends with this young man, and when he came on board, she told her crew, \"This guy's gonna be staying with us for a while. Take care of him, now.\"\\nThe sailors trusted Beidou's judgment and admired the newcomer for his martial prowess, not to mention his ability to predict the weather, so they were happy to overlook his reticence to discuss his past, and welcomed him aboard.\\nStill, their curiosity did not abate, and they would often find all sorts of excuses to try and ply him for information about his experiences.\\n\"I've heard that they make some sweet blades there in Inazuma and that the bigger the fish you are, the swankier the sword. So, uh... how's yours measure up?\"\\n\"...\"\\nKazuha would remain silent in the face of all such queries.\\nOver time, after countless attempts to garner a response proved futile, the sailors would simply give up asking.\\nEventually, it was an off-the-cuff remark from Chief Mate, Juza, just a few days later that finally managed to elicit a reply.\\n\"Hey, Inazuma boy. What are the lads supposed to call you if they don't even know your name?\"\\nThe young sailor wiped the sweat from his brow with his callused hands.\\n\"My name is Kaedehara Kazuha, a wandering samurai. I am in your debt for taking me in, so just call me 'Kazuha.'\"",
            "Character Story 2\tKazuha was not born a commoner. He hails from an Inazuman noble house of old, the last son of the Kaedehara Clan.\\nInazuma City is home to many illustrious clans, and the Kaedehara name was once one of the most renowned among them. But fortune is fickle, and the Kaedeharas' fortunes had already collapsed by the time they were Kazuha's to inherit.\\nAs the young master of the house, Kazuha could do nothing but watch as his family's future crumbled around him. But as helpless as this made him feel, when the moment came that the home was officially repossessed and the last attendant was finally dismissed, he breathed a sigh of relief: As far as he was concerned, this was a golden opportunity to begin leading a free and wandering life.\\nHe had always longed to roam the mountains and forests, and had held a deep admiration for the beauty and authenticity of nature since his youth.\\nTo Kazuha, nature had never been silent. It had always spoken to him, conveying its feelings in its own unique language.\\nWhen the wind ceases to speak and the world falls silent, that is the calm before the skies begin to weep. When silent springs suddenly leap into activity, it is the omen of a great earthquake.\\nThese are the unique poetics that nature has bestowed upon him, and Kazuha was never one to be preoccupied with luxury anyway — so if the burden of family responsibility should drop from his shoulders, why not go wandering, and travel light?\\nThus did Kazuha strike out on his journey, like a falling leaf in the yard carried away by the wind.",
            "Character Story 3\tAll travelers who outdoors roam need some skill to call their own. For Kazuha, this is his ability to read the sounds of nature.\\nAfter leaving Inazuma City, Kazuha wandered here and there. Things were different now: all of nature was his treasured home, and the sounds of wind and water beneath the sight of drifting clouds set his heart at ease.\\nAll that he saw on the road filled him with curiosity. It was in this state of mind that Kazuha arrived at a mountain in the south.\\nIt was early summer, and the frequent and heavy rainfall had turned the mountain roads to mud. Seeing that night was soon to fall, Kazuha decided to find somewhere to shelter from the rain. No sooner had he had this thought than he turned around to see a small straw hut at the far end of the road.\\nThe traveling merchant with whom he was traveling at that time whooped for joy at the sight of the hut: \"Kazuha, look! We'll have a roof over our heads tonight!\"\\nBut Kazuha did not speak. He paused and listened intently for a long while before he finally replied: \"If you were to ask my opinion... it may be best to stay away.\"\\nBut the merchant did not wish to remain in the rain. He left Kazuha and made his way to the house.\\nUpon knocking at the door, the traveling merchant was met by a lovely woman who offered him shelter, tea, food, and even bedding for the night.\\nPerhaps it was the excellent food, but the merchant quickly became drowsy and fell asleep immediately after finishing his meal.\\nWhen he awoke the following morning, there was no roof over his head. The bright sunlight pierced his eyes, and all he could see was Kazuha stood nearby, looking down at him and smiling.\\nBefore the merchant could speak, he vomited a great pile of leaves and mud. And as for the bedding upon which he had slept so soundly, ah, it too was mud.\\nKazuha smiled and said: \"The wind is weaker where there are houses. Yet here stood a hut, and there was no change in the mountain breeze. I think you might have been the victim of a bake-danuki's prank. Never mind. Next time, listen more closely to the wind and tread with care.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tKazuha made many friends during his travels. One of them was particularly close to his heart, and for a time, the two journeyed together.\\nBut they too would part, for their destinations were different.\\nTo have met merely by chance and then form such a strong bond, there must be a fated connection between them... so, although they would part ways for now, surely they would meet again. Or so Kazuha thought.\\nBut something happened soon thereafter that would shatter his calm disposition — the Almighty Shogun promulgated the Vision Hunt Decree and swore to retrieve all Visions.\\nAll who wielded them, including Kazuha, were stricken with panic, concealing their identities and going into hiding.\\nIt was then that Kazuha received shocking news: Someone had dared to call for a \"duel before the throne,\" and that someone was none other than Kazuha's dear friend.\\nThe defeated party in a duel before the throne would face punishment at the hand of the Shogun herself. His friend was prepared to risk all to come before the throne, partly for the chance to fight against a strong foe, but also to demonstrate the meaning of courage to all.\\nAnd yet, to call for this challenge now, of all times... Kazuha feared that his punishment, should he fail, would be absolute: The Almighty Shogun would unleash her lightning upon him in its full fury, and it would surely take his life.\\nEven the normally calm Kazuha could not restrain himself. He drew his sword and stormed into Tenshukaku like a whirlwind... But alas, he arrived too late.\\nHis friend's sword lay shattered in pieces, his Vision now an empty husk. Now a wanted man himself, Kazuha fled with grief in his heart.\\nFrom that moment on, the days of peaceful wanderings were over, and Kazuha's life became an unending series of battles.\\nKazuha did not fear battle, of course, but the constant fighting left him feeling lost and perplexed.\\nHe did not regret having set out on his doomed rescue mission, nor did he begrudge his friend for leaving him, but he could not help but think...\\n\"Is this endless conflict truly the only way to assert one's ideals?\"",
            "Character Story 5\tThe Crux Fleet became Kazuha's new home, and he drifted on the ocean wherever it took him.\\nTrouble still found him from time to time, but no issue was insurmountable with the support of the Crux crew.\\nFrom his vantage point on the Alcor's crow's nest, gazing out at the azure sea and sky, he finally had the space to think over the tumultuous events of his past and what it all meant to him.\\n\"Every samurai wishes to live their life with passion and to claim the greatest reputation possible using the sword in their hands.\"\\n\"But there will always be those whose base desires lead them astray from the path of justice and virtue, and whose blades leave an endless trail of enmity in their wake.\"\\n\"Surely the heavens did not give us fleshly forms and the gods did not watch over our lives all so that we might take up arms against one another.\"\\n\"Then, this sword I wield is not meant to slay, but to save...\"\\n\"Yes, this shall be my path as a samurai, and I shall defend it all my days.\"\\nAs he reached the conclusion of his thoughts, Kazuha was suddenly inspired to pen down a few verses to serve as a maxim for himself thereafter... but before he could get started, he was interrupted by an irate voice from down below:\\n\"Hey, Kazuha, quit gawking at the sky — get down here and lend a hand!\"\\nIt seemed the maxim would have to wait for another day. Whatever the helmsman, Sea Drake, needed help with clearly couldn't wait.",
            "Vision Shell\t",
            "Vision\tThe morning mist covered the mountains like a blanket as Kazuha trod a small trail alone.\\nThe world was silent. Not a single feather flapped, and not a single cicada sang.\\nEven the roiling waves seemed to have fallen into slumber, leaving just the faint whisper of the wind audible against the silence. Kazuha stuck out his tongue — the air tasted heavy and gloomy.\\nThis told him that it would soon rain.\\nHe peered into the distance and spotted a plume of smoke up ahead. Below it were several straw huts. Tonight, it seemed, he would have a roof over his head.\\nHe informed the owner of the house that a storm was coming. At first, he was met with skepticism, but come noon the rains arrived right on cue.\\nIn awe of this wanderer's skill, the master of the house eagerly offered him lodging.\\nThe storm raged into the night. Kazuha held his quilt close, and as he listened to the onslaught of rain against the autumn leaves, his mind began to wander.\\nIn the time since the Kaedehara Clan's fortune had faded away and he had set off on his journey, Kazuha had traveled across many of Inazuma's islands and had become intimately acquainted with the plight of the wanderer.\\nMoving between islands usually necessitated traveling by sea. Kazuha would make these trips alone, in a small, slow boat, making things all the more perilous when he had to battle against strong headwinds or violent thunderstorms...\\nAnd yet, there was limitless fascination to be found in this same journey of his, where the vast sky and boundless earth was his home, and all living things that inhabited them were his friends.\\nIf one's heart is empty, all under heaven is empty.\\nBut if one's heart is pure, all under heaven is pure.\\nWith his sword in his hand and his chosen path in his heart, he could go on his way with a song on his lips and with nothing to fear, no matter the perils he may face.\\nKazuha slept soundly that night, his mind at rest having made peace with his feelings.\\nThe next day, he awoke to the sound of birds... and a shining Vision lying upon his chest."

On the contrary, he actually enjoys putting people into the difficult position of making tough decisions.\\nHe takes pleasure in seeing the hesitation in his comrades' eyes in the moment just before they dive into battle with him, just as he takes pleasure in the look of fear in his enemies' eyes as they face off against him.",
            "Character Story 3\tThe flourishing winery business in Mondstadt has been a great source of prosperity in the region over the years. This prosperity often entices greedy bandits and monsters to the area.\\nThey are a motley bunch who hide in the shadows, and their backgrounds, motives, and allegiances are varied and complex.\\nKaeya battles against this threat to Mondstadt not only with his sword, but also with his smarts and his wit.\\nA young knight once dedicated years of his life to studying threats in and around Mondstadt, and reached an astounding conclusion:\\nWhen Death After Noon is out of season due to lack of supply, the number of reported incidents inside and outside the city show a drastic decrease, and this remains the case until Death After Noon returns to the market...\\nThe young knight showed his findings to Cavalry Captain Kaeya in hopes of getting some advice from him.\\n\"Interesting. I'll look into it.\" Kaeya answered, with a wry smirk on his face.",
            "Character Story 4\tGenerally speaking, Kaeya is an easy person to have a conversation with. The only topic that you will never hear him discuss is his past.\\nEven when the Grand Master demanded information on his background, Kaeya skirted around the issue and gave only vague answers devoid of details.\\n\"One afternoon near the end of summer a decade ago, my father and I passed by the Dawn Winery.\"\\n\"'I'll go get us some grape juice for the road,' he said, but he never came back.\"\\n\"If Master Crepus hadn't taken me in, I doubt I'd have made it through the storm that night.\"\\nThis matter-of-fact description hides a carefully constructed lie.\\nKaeya has never once spoken the truth about what happened that afternoon:\\n\"This is your chance. You are our last hope.\"\\nKaeya's father squeezed his son's lean shoulders as he spoke, seemingly looking right through Kaeya to some place far beyond.\\nOn the other side of the horizon sat their distant homeland of Khaenri'ah.\\nKaeya would never forget the look of both hope and hatred in his father's eyes as he uttered those words.",
            "Character Story 5\tMany citizens still remember the two most eye-catching young gentlemen in all of Mondstadt a few years ago.\\nOne of them was the dapper Diluc, an elegant swordsman who always had a warm smile and a confident posture.\\nThe other was the eccentric Kaeya. He was Diluc's friend, supporter, and sounding board, ensuring he got through every challenge he faced smoothly.\\nThey were almost like twins, knowing each other's thoughts and intentions without a word, protecting Mondstadt in both light and dark.\\n...Until that fateful day, now ingrained deep in Kaeya's memory, when the convoy that Diluc was escorting was attacked by a huge monster.\\nIt was the first and only time that Kaeya failed in his duty.\\nBy the time Kaeya finally reached Diluc, it was all over.\\nThe power their father had used to successfully fend off the attack backfired, taking their father's life.\\nBoth Kaeya and Diluc were shocked by what they had witnessed, losing the calm composure a knight should retain.\\n\"Even someone like Master Crepus would submit to such a dangerous and evil power...\"\\nSinister thoughts flashed through Kaeya's mind, and he simply smirked:\\n\"This world is truly... fascinating.\"\\nAll while their father lay dead in a pool of his own blood. It was on that night that the two sons' paths diverged.",

            "Vision\tIt was raining heavily in Mondstadt on the night that Kaeya Alberich received his Vision.\\nEarlier that day, Crepus Ragnvindr had wielded the power of a Delusion — only to become its victim when it backfired. To set his father free from the unbearable agony, Diluc Ragnvindr took his life.\\nKaeya was Diluc's brother by adoption and was always by his side, but on this occasion Kaeya did not partake in the final moments shared between father and son.\\nThe torrential rain that set in on Mondstadt that night seemed to be a sign of the heavens' grief at the passing of Master Crepus.\\nThere was a side to Kaeya that he kept hidden from the world: In truth, he was an agent of Khaenri'ah, placed in Mondstadt to serve their interests. His father had abandoned him in this strange and unknown land to fulfill this mission, and it was Master Crepus and the city of Mondstadt that had welcomed him with open arms when they found him.\\nIf Khaenri'ah and Mondstadt went to war, which side should he support? To whom should he offer his assistance: his birth father, who had ruthlessly abandoned him? Or his adoptive father, who had loved him and raised him?\\nFor the longest time, Kaeya had agonized over these impossible questions, caught between the opposing demands of loyalty and duty, faced with an impossible choice between truth and happiness.\\nBut now, Crepus' death upset this delicate balance. He felt liberated, but also ashamed of how selfishly he was responding. As an adopted son, he should have saved Crepus, but he had arrived moments too late. As a brother, he should have shared in Diluc's grief, and yet as their father lay dying on the ground, he had hung back behind his brother, that ancient plot running through his mind.\\nConsumed by guilt, Kaeya knocked on Diluc's door. As the rain poured down, the shroud of secrecy was washed away and all lies were revealed. Kaeya had finally come clean.\\nHe had anticipated Diluc's anger. The brothers drew their blades, this time pointing them at each other. Kaeya felt that this was his punishment for a lifetime of lies.\\nBut as the two crossed blades, Kaeya was overcome by the sensation of great elemental power surging through him. For years, he had stayed out of the way in his brother's shadow. But now, for the first time ever, he was facing his brother as his true self.\\nBitterly cold and brittle elemental energy burst forth from the tip of his sword to meet Diluc’s searing flames head-on. The clash of crimson fire and azure ice created a sudden swirl of wind that stunned them both. This was the grim moment at which Kaeya's Vision appeared.\\nSince that day, Kaeya and Diluc have gone their separate ways. But he never discusses it, just as he never discusses the origin of his Vision.\\nThough it is a reminder of a hard-fought battle, and the prize that he earned in exchange for revealing the unadulterated truth, Kaeya sees it as a stern reminder that he must live the rest of his life under the heavy burden of lies."

While his younger sister, Ayaka, known by all as the Princess, takes care of the clan's internal and external affairs.\\nAyaka often appears at social occasions and has more interactions with the common folk. As such, she is better known by the people and has gained a higher reputation than her elder brother. This has earned her the elegant title of Shirasagi Himegimi.\\nAs is known to all, Ayaka, the daughter of the Kamisato family, is a figure greatly admired by the people for her beauty, dignified demeanor, and noble character.",
            "Character Story 1\tAcross Inazuma, all affairs of state that do not go up to the Raiden Shogun are largely handled by the Triarchal Council.\\nThe Council's executive powers are, in turn, divided amongst three groups known as the Tri-Commission: the Yashiro Commission, the Tenryou Commission, and the Kanjou Commission.\\nThe three clans that hold power over these Commissions are as follows: Kamisato, Kujou, and Hiiragi. These three great clans are known throughout Inazuma.\\nKamisato Ayaka is the young lady of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan, known far and wide as the Shirasagi Himegimi.\\nWhen asked the whys and wherefores of such a nickname, many Inazumans have their own explanations...\\n\"Lady Ayaka is as graceful and pure as an egret. And just look at her elegance, her clever yet proper speech — why should she not be named a Princess?\"\\n\"Lady Ayaka may be of noble birth, but she is gentle and polite to us. She is kind, loyal, and is willing to help others. She even went against the opinions of others and took in that commoner, Thoma.\"\\nThere are as many opinions concerning this as there are people, but none can say where the \"Shirasagi Himegimi\" nickname actually originated.\\nStill, Ayaka's popularity amongst the people is quite plain to see.",
            "Character Story 2\tAs the daughter of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan, Ayaka always has to remain alert to the jostling for power between noble families.\\nBeing young, yet already famed throughout the land, she has been the inevitable target of provocation on the part of other noble scions who have grown jealous of the Kamisato siblings.\\nThe creation and maintenance of a public image may be a formality, but for a house of standing like the Kamisato Clan, even meaningless routine has social significance.\\nFailing to take part in the tangled web of Inazuman political relations risks their position as head of the Yashiro Commission. As such, the two siblings came to an accord.\\nThe elder brother, Ayato, preferring not to show his face too often, would busy himself with government affairs, while the act of maintaining the clan's image would be the responsibility of the elegant, socially-adroit younger sister, Ayaka.\\nThrough her dignified, demure and polite posture, Ayaka has very much secured a place for herself in the social arena. Whether she is negotiating with potential partners or dealing with difficult nobles, her actions are all well-founded and beyond reproach.\\nThe internal clan affairs are also in her care. Indeed, their estates may have descended into chaos already, if not for her.",
            "Character Story 3\tOne autumn afternoon, Ayaka was on her way home from completing certain minor affairs when she happened to hear an old voice singing from within an old house.\\nWithin was an old woman, blind in both eyes, whose stick-thin fingers produced music like flowing water as they plucked at her instrument's strings.\\nPerhaps it was due to her sharp ears, but the old lady heard Ayaka's footsteps and inquired as to who was outside. Not wishing to trouble the old lady, Ayaka replied that she was a nearby resident who had gotten lost and entered this place.\\nAs a member of the Yashiro Commission, Ayaka was well-acquainted with the peoples' lives and quickly recognized this solitary old lady as the very same person who busked in the city streets when the weather was good.\\nThe tune was outdated, and so was the song. As one who could not see, this lady had long fallen out of step with the times. Even in the nation that pursues eternity, some still endured such hard lives.\\nOut of the goodness of her heart, Ayaka, thusly incognito, spent a long time chatting with the old lady. Taking Ayaka for an ordinary maiden, the old lady spoke of the method of making and playing the koto, and even gave her some tea leaves that she had kept stored up.\\nCompared to the exquisite leaves that the Kamisato Clan had in stock, these rough leaves may as well have been grass, but Ayaka accepted them while profusely thanking her.\\nThat day, she thought of her parents many times. Had they been around, would they not have grown this old someday?\\nReturning home, she spoke of her encounter with her brother, and the two siblings shared the rustic tea gifted to her by the old lady.\\nAfterward, Ayaka would come to see that old lady again every few days, each time posing as a person living nearby, and each time bringing with her some daily necessities that were well-loved by the common folk.\\n\"The sakura trees in the streets have bloomed again,\" Ayaka said to the old lady with a smile, \"and they are as lovely as your music.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tIn people's imagination, the nobility's living expenses are orders of magnitude above the common folk. So for someone as noble as Kamisato Ayaka, surely she too must lead a life of wanton luxury.\\nThis statement is only half right, however.\\nAyaka does ostensibly live in a much more particular manner than the ordinary citizen.\\nThe costs of studying flower arrangement and tea ceremony, sampling fine teas, and enjoying exotic flowers daily are also by no means small. However, these are all skills that she must master as a young lady of a noble house — such commitments can hardly be called \"wanton.\"\\nThe things that can truly make Ayaka smile are, in fact, ordinary things that even the common folk can enjoy.\\nThe making of snacks, fishing for goldfish by the ponds, squirreling herself away to read the latest novels from Yae Publishing House... Each one of these is but a tiny matter.\\nAt such times, she is not the adored Shirasagi Himegimi, or Lady Ayaka, mistress of the great Kamisato estates. She is just \"Ayaka,\" an ordinary girl like any other.\\nHere, she sets her dignified externalized persona aside and sets her true, casual self free. Only as \"Ayaka\" can she lay down her heavy burdens and do the things that ordinary girls can do.\\nWhen hungry at night, she sneaks past the servants into the kitchen and makes herself some chazuke while humming a little tune. During tea ceremony classes, she might surreptitiously try to use the tea leaves to indulge in some romance-related astrology... The list of her little escapades goes on.\\nThough she has never told anyone this, Ayaka treasures her time as an ordinary girl above all else, for these moments of freedom are things she rarely ever has.",
            "Character Story 5\tThe tutors who guide Ayaka in her various arts once used to say: whether in tea ceremony, chess, the art of the sword, or all other affairs of elegance, Ayaka is already a master.\\nShe is clearly already a noble lady of superb bearing, skilled with both the pen and the sword. To be able to teach such a pupil is a teacher's pride and joy.\\nStill, Ayaka thinks quietly to herself, does she truly have no regrets?\\nThe essence of tea is peace and quiet.\\nThe heart of the sword is the keenest edge.\\nThe soul of chess is the wisdom to grasp the bigger picture.\\nThese three she has grasped indeed, and the spirit of true friendship also.\\nAnd yet, Ayaka is still waiting for a friend to emerge who can walk alongside her on equal footing and stand by her side.\\nThat person cannot see her as a member of the Yashiro Commission, or as the Shirasagi Himegimi, nor will their conduct towards her be bound by decorum or status. And if possible, they might also be well-versed in a great many fields of study, and have witnessed all manner of interesting things... and perhaps they might even be able to tell her a story in a pinch.\\nOnly such a person might become Ayaka's bosom friend.\\n\"Surely, this is not too much to ask... But where might I find such a person?\"",
            "Moriwakamaru\t\"Come, come, come,\"\\n\"Let's play Temari!\"\\n\"1, 2, 1, 2, 3,\"\\n\"The Temari goes up the Sacred Sakura Tree.\"\\n\"4, 5, 4, 5, 6,\"\\n\"Woosh, and over Mt. Yougou it flicks!\"\\n\"7, 8, 7, 8, 9,\"\\n\"The Temari returns into these hands of mine.\"\\n\"Yes, into little~ Ayaka's~ hands~!\"\\nThis was Ayaka's favorite nursery rhyme back in the day.\\nBack then, she gave her favorite Temari the name \"Moriwakamaru,\" and she would dribble the multi-colored Moriwakamaru about while humming this very song.\\nHearing her song, her parents and brother would be unable to stop themselves from smiling. Indeed, they would often join in the fun, tossing the Temari between them as a family.\\nBut that was a long time ago, and Ayaka no longer plays games of Temari.\\nShe has become an independent, powerful figure in her own right — and Moriwakamaru, the symbol of her childhood and the bearer of her precious memories, has also been stored away within Ayaka's cabinet.",
            "Vision\tSome years ago, the Clan underwent a huge change, and a heavy burden fell upon Ayato's shoulders. At that time, Ayaka was not yet the mature and capable person she is now.\\nShe was originally a playful child, one who knew nothing of the clan's duties, and thus lacked the skill and experience needed for dealing with various kinds of people altogether.\\nBut seeing her mother on her sickbed and her brother hard at work, Ayaka sensed that she too had to grow up.\\nSo she decided to take up her long-disused sword arts and poetry, both staples of nobility. If she could master these two, she could at least pass for a decent lady of the Kamisato Clan, and thus help her brother show up at some festivals, alleviating his burden.\\nTruth be told, Ayaka was not preternaturally gifted and would spend much time being troubled by her inability to memorize poetry, write elegantly, or brandish her sword.\\nYet she did not waver — a poem she failed to memorize once would be memorized fifty times, a poorly-written word would be written fifty times over, and a sword technique that failed would be swung fifty times more.\\n\"None may deflect a swing that has been practiced a thousand times.\" — This was something her mother told her.\\nWhen her mother left this world, Ayaka was no longer \"Little Ayaka.\" She was now Kamisato Ayaka, the young lady of the Kamisato Clan, one of the Shogun's three great clans.\\nSword art training thus became part of her daily life and has remained so to this day without pause.\\nOn one particular day, Ayaka, at last, defeated an opponent in a single strike. In that instant, as she stood in the middle of the dojo, icy flowers condensed all about her. And there, upon the tip of her sword, now hung a Vision, icy and bright.\\n\"None may deflect a swing that has been practiced a thousand times\" indeed — and even the gods may thus be moved."

Lots of things come up that I just have no idea about, and of everyone in Liyue, she's probably the most familiar with Rex Lapis. Heh...

In addition to reviewing his own past deeds, I've been researching the other archons' modes of governance, too.

            "Character Details\tRex Lapis has brought prosperity and plenty to Liyue Harbor, and his rule and majesty have long passed into show and song, much to the delight of the people. But for someone in such proximity to a god, Keqing seems to lack the requisite respect the most.\\n\"Hmph. Let's be real here, but does Morax really know everything?\"\\nThe Liyue Qixing deal with the day-to-day happenings in the Harbor, whether great or small, while Rex Lapis only descends once a year.\\nWhile history has shown that following Morax's lead has been the right call, Keqing believes that humans should have their pride and that their views deserve equal consideration.\\nAs such, she often advocates different opinions from Rex Lapis, and is the first to put such views into practice.\\nHer radical actions have seen stellar results, but they have also attracted murmurings of opprobrium among those devoted to Rex Lapis.\\nAs Keqing sees it, such opposition are the excuses of those who have grown complacent under the aegis of their deity, and who cannot consider the future of humanity of their own accord.\\nBut someone must walk on the front line of the epoch and create a new path with their own hands — and the Yuheng star is determined to do her part in this endeavor.",
            "Character Story 1\tKeqing is the daughter of an illustrious Liyue family with a proud lineage, and she is better acquainted than most with the influence that Rex Lapis has over the people of Liyue.\\nOnce every few years, in an almost cyclical fashion, a major reshuffle hits Liyue's economy after the Rite of Descension. Once Rex Lapis' new policies are announced, some families celebrate while others grieve.\\nThe poor hope it will offer them the chance to finally make their fortunes while the wealthy pray that theirs will not be swept away in the changing tides. Rather than carefully analyzing the economic climate, merchants are more prone to making investments based on belief.\\nAnd in present-day Liyue, this is a forgivable strategy: Rex Lapis is a powerful deity and he can be relied on for all things.\\nBut Keqing has her reservations about all this: What if, one day, Rex Lapis stops fulfilling his duty? Then what would become of the people of Liyue?\\nLiyue's present prosperity is akin to a magnificent sandcastle on the beach — humanity does not have the luxury of deciding when the tide will come in.\\nHowever, Keqing has been unable to garner majority support for her views. From most people's perspective, life is but a brief, insignificant moment in Liyue's long history, and there is no point in working oneself up into an existential quandary.\\nThis perspective, as far as Keqing is concerned, is a lazy and cowardly one that denies there is any value at all in the existence of the human race. \"If humans really have no value,\" Keqing retorts, \"then why should we expect the gods to care about us so much?\"\\nUnwilling to compromise on her beliefs, she cast her skepticism on everything — everything from Rex Lapis' loving-kindness, to the people's laziness, to the way that society runs.\\nIssues affecting humans' fate should be handled by humans, and humans are more than capable of handling them with finesse.\\nFinally, the day came of her now-famous speech at the Rite of Descension.\\n\"Rex Lapis has watched over Liyue for a millennium. But what about the next millennium? What about the next ten, or the next hundred millennia? How long are we expecting this status quo to last?\"\\nOn hearing these words, Rex Lapis burst into hearty laughter. But as for what exactly he was laughing about, only Rex Lapis himself knows.",
            "Character Story 2\tSome may be able to keep up with Keqing's forward-thinking ideas, but none can keep up with her pace of work.\\nPerhaps in an effort to become a role model for her people, she demands of herself to work ten times harder than the average person, and she cannot abide any measure of laziness or inefficiency.\\nHumans' abilities and lifespans are more limited than the gods'. This means that one has no hope of living to see the day when humans replace the gods as masters of our own universe if one allows apathy and hesitation to slow themselves down.\\nBecause of this same mindset, she is never able to synchronize her work rhythm with the people around her.\\nWhatever the task, she does not rest until the job is done, and when something should take half the month to resolve, she will pull out all the stops to try and get it turned around within the next 48 hours.\\nAdditionally, Keqing's notion of 'completing' something is far more ambitious than simply getting it 'finished' — she will make sure that every relevant detail is tied up too. To the outside observer, she seems to be both highly efficient and a perfectionist.\\nBut not everyone is as self-motivated as Keqing. No assistant she hires ever makes it past the three-month mark.\\nShe has received countless remonstrations urging her to be less impatient, but she meets each one with a stern rejection.\\nStill, she has, to some extent, come around to the idea that a high staff turnover is itself a manifestation of inefficiency, and made some concessions accordingly.\\nToday, if you encounter an assistant of Keqing's dealing with some matter three, four, or even five years ahead of time, don't be alarmed, this is completely normal. Keqing gave them a bit of a head start, but she'll be catching up before long.",
            "Character Story 3\t\"Yesterday's experiences make me stronger today.\" This is one of the principles Keqing lives by.\\nSpending all of one's time at Yujing Terrace means seeing the same old things day after day. But to be able to think and act as swiftly as lightning, one needs a huge amount of experience to draw on.\\nSo, if Keqing sees something that needs doing, why, she'll do it herself. For example, she once served for two months as a laborer to better decide how to refine a plan to improve their treatment.\\nIt's hard to imagine that this young lady with so much authority vested in her has pulled carts at the Chasm, rammed earth at the south wharf, and waited tables at small diners.\\nIn addition to working, she also once took the opportunity to gather evidence with which to report a powerful individual known for his abuses.\\nHe was apprehended without any clue as to how he had been exposed, but when he was brought to the interrogation chamber by the Millelith, there he saw a striking young lady dressed in fine robes.\\n\"Hey! Haven't we... haven't we met somewhere before?\"\\nThe words felt foolish the moment they rolled off his tongue, even to him.\\nEspecially because the Millelith then introduced her as follows: \"This is the Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing. Know your place and keep your distance!\"\\n—Exactly, so what was he thinking!?",
            "Character Story 4\tRex Lapis' departure has put Liyue Harbor through a great deal of hardship. All the duties Rex once fulfilled have been taken up by the Qixing and the Eight Trades.\\nNow that divine rule is a thing of the past, the old strictures left behind can't simply be continued wholesale. But to establish new laws for Liyue, whose history spans several thousand years, is no mean feat.\\nAt first, Keqing was incredibly enthusiastic about this task, having long prepared for this day when she might finally show her mettle. But several months in, and she was still stuck on a single task, land infrastructure — and it was driving her up the wall.\\nNo matter how hard she struggled, the mountain of tasks was like a quagmire. She was making difference, yes, but not nearly with as much ease as Rex Lapis.\\n\"Why can I only do this much? Why... can't I do it better?\"\\nOf course, she had long understood the wherefores here.\\nHer lack of respect for gods had somehow received their recognition all the same, yes, but that didn't mean that she was ready to simply replace them.\\nBut she was still Keqing, resolute and tenacious.\\nFrom that day on, she shut herself in, studying classics of various kinds to learn all that she needed. Placing herself lowest, she accepted all that she had hitherto not known with open arms.\\nDuring this period, she gained a certain calm, slowly discarding the \"opprobrium\" she had long held against Rex Lapis.\\nThey were both working for the good of Liyue, after all — and two people who love the same thing need not be on opposing sides.\\nShe also seemingly came to an understanding concerning the smile Rex Lapis had given her during that Rite of Descension. It was, Keqing now believes, an expression of acknowledgment and expectation.\\nShe hasn't lost any of her forceful and decisive manner, no. But sometimes, when she feels lost, she will stop and think: \"What would Rex Lapis do at a moment such as this?\"",
            "Character Story 5\tKeqing, who has dedicated a large portion of her energies to Liyue Harbor, indulges in an unexpected pastime when she can spare a moment — shopping.\\nOn her days off, she changes into ordinary clothes, contacts a few close friends, and enjoys a day of strolling around Feiyun Slope and Chihu Rock, just enjoying the act of buying things.\\nAfter Rex Lapis' departure, Keqing managed to maintain this method of decompression despite her busier schedule, though with one subtle difference.\\nOn one of her shopping trips, she happened upon a small and unremarkable stall that sold cute Rex Lapis clay figurines with tiny bodies and big heads.\\nPersuading her friends to visit the silk store opposite, she approached the stall, took a figurine in her hand, and began to examine it.\\nShe knew that she didn't have much time. So, after glancing around to make sure that no one was watching, she paid for, picked up, and packed away her prize in one swift single movement.\\nBut no sooner had she placed the figurine into her bag and heaved a sigh of relief than one of her friends, silk bundles in tow, tapped her on the shoulder.\\nIn the end, all was revealed. Her friends were quite curious: Wasn't Keqing a skeptic among skeptics? Why would she buy one of these?\\n\"For... For introspection, of course! There's nothing wrong with self-reflection, is there?\"\\nSo she said, and it would be convincing, too — if Keqing didn't already have an entire shelf dedicated to Rex Lapis self-reflection memorabilia...",
            "Survival Hairpin\tThough she is of noble birth, Keqing tries to keep her luxuries to the bare minimum that would befit her position as one of the Liyue Qixing.\\nAnd when she is outside the borders of the prosperous city, she will often head deep into uninhabited areas to strengthen her knowledge and sharpen her will.\\nShe has experienced countless challenges, but unlike backpackers and adventurers, she does not bring anything with but her hairpin and her sword.\\nAs long as it is infused with Electro, a hairpin can become a knife of unmatched sharpness. Cutting grass, chopping firewood, skinning game and carving bone are all well within its capabilities.\\nIf faced with a drop of great height, she only needs to pin it into the ground, tie rattans to it, and rappel down.\\nIt also serves as an incredibly sensitive security device when camping out. Any unusual movements nearby will cause it, when tipped over and placed perpendicular to the ground, to alert and awaken Keqing immediately.\\nIt can even be used to fish: Keqing just hurls it into the water when she's feeling peckish, and there will always be a few fish that will get knocked out by the electric shock — and of course, finding a stick to grill the fish on is not a problem either.\\nSome narrow-minded folk have ridiculed Keqing's hairpin for being old and worn, but this does not anger her. Indeed, she considers it a point of pride.\\n\"Its weathered form is what gives it its charm.\"",
            "Vision\tKeqing is likely a skeptic without equal when it comes to the value of Visions.\\nShe knows that everything she has is the result of her own hard work, but that in the eyes of others, credit has been given instead to her Vision.\\nShe once believed that this purple crystal had stolen the pride due originally to her, and that it was both a challenge and an insult from the gods.\\nIn fact, she has tried to destroy her Vision countless times — she's left it in a huge fire for three days and three nights, run over it with a minecart full of rocks, and has even hurled it from the heights of the Jade Chamber.\\nUnfortunately, she has never been successful.\\nWith no options left, and not wanting it to fall into the wrong hands, Keqing was forced to accept the Vision as part of her life.\\nOver time, Keqing came to appreciate her Vision. She realized that this item did not actually have any divine will imbued within it, and that it also had numerous practical uses. Thus, she decided to make use of it.\\n\"The source of power is far less important than the character of its user.\"\\nRegardless of how she may once have regarded it, Keqing's Vision and its powers have become a part of her.\\nThank the Archons she hadn't destroyed it back then, or she'd have regretted it for sure — oh, the hardships of being a pragmatist."

            "More About Klee: III\tSure, time in solitary confinement gives lots of time to think about new gunpowder formulas... But it'd still be better to not be in solitary in the first place.",

            "Character Details\tWhen the patrons of Mondstadt's taverns are asked about the strongest knight of the Knights of Favonius, three names are likely to come up:\\nThe highly reputable Acting Grand Master Jean, Cavalry Captain Kaeya, and the mysterious tycoon, Diluc.\\nHowever, some claim to have witnessed, albeit through bleary, drunken eyes, a knight in red, leveling the entire Stormbearer Mountains.\\nIf one wants to find this mysterious knight, then they need look no further than the solitary confinement cell inside the Knights of Favonius Headquarters.\\nIf the cell is found vacant... then something explosively unfortunate is likely about to take place...\\nKlee is well known for the danger she presents. As an official member of the Knights of Favonius, her strength in combat cannot be underestimated.\\nAs a hyperactive child, meanwhile, her destructive capabilities cannot be overstated.\\nAfter all, while other Mondstadt children her age are still playing with regular toys, Klee's favorite toys are... live explosives.",
            "Character Story 1\tThree years ago, Klee was entrusted to the Knights of Favonius by her parents, who were famed adventurers.\\nThis was how the fates of Klee and \"that boy in white\" became intertwined with their \"family\" in Mondstadt.\\nKlee is curious about everything in the outside world. She has an innocent passion for explosives, and is incredibly enthusiastic in all that she does.\\nUnder the protection of the Knights of Favonius, she is protected from harm and those of ill intent.\\nThis young girl soon forged an unbreakable bond with everyone in the Knights of Favonius.\\nBeing sent to the solitary confinement by Jean, helping Amber improving Baron Bunny, as well as developing new bombs...\\nThese parts of Klee's life are all invaluable treasures to her.",
            "Character Story 2\t\"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree...\"\\nJean sighs to herself as she sits down at her desk, head in hands, faced once again with a stack of damage reports.\\nCarts blasted beyond repair, storage shacks burnt down, forest fires that the knights barely managed to contain...\\nNot to mention the suspiciously high number of deaths from unnatural causes among the fish of Starfell Lake.\\nThere's only one potential culprit behind all of this, and she just so happens to be one of their own...\\n\"Klee!\"\\nFaced with Jean's stern glare, the harmless-looking Klee surrenders all her concealed explosives.\\nShe is then escorted to solitary confinement, despite her protests amidst floods of tears.\\nThis occurs about once or twice a week at the Knights of Favonius.",
            "Character Story 3\tOf course, Klee always tries to help clean up the messes she's made.\\nHowever, sometimes her reckless personality makes things worse still.\\nFor example, she once wanted to apologize to everyone by making some BBQ fish, but ended up blowing the stove sky-high.\\nThen there was the time she got into a fluster and tried to put the fire out... with wind — which obviously resulted in the whole plain going up in flames.\\nKlee is not a bad kid by nature, it's just that her curious and playful nature always results in her failing to think before she acts.\\nAnd every time she gets into trouble, she guiltily tries to make up for it.\\nThough once Jean lets Klee out of solitary confinement, there's usually no more than a day or two before the sound of explosions return to Mondstadt.\\nThe \"Spark Knight\" always manages to live up to her title in a range of unexpected ways.",
            "Character Story 4\tThough Klee always ends up causing trouble for the Knights of Favonius and Mondstadt, she isn't just some rookie who drags the team down.\\nOn the contrary, her skills with explosives can be quite handy if applied correctly.\\nOnce, Jean was able to defeat a horde of invading hilichurls utilizing Klee's special talents alone.\\nHowever, Klee also forever changed the face of Stormbearer Mountains in that same operation due to recklessly placing too many charges...\\nNeedless to say, everyone was more than a little shocked, but at least no one from the Knights of Favonius was injured.\\nSince then, the legend of the \"Red Knight of the Stormbearer Mountains\" began to circulate around Mondstadt.\\nRumor has it that she is cloaked in red, and clutches the greatest treasure the Knights of Favonius have.\\nHowever, only Klee knows what this \"treasure\" truly is.",
            "Character Story 5\tTo Klee, the Knights of Favonius are family, and she can't imagine life without them. Her biggest role model, however, is still her birth mother — the avid adventurer, Alice.\\nA highly renowned adventurer and author of the popular Teyvat Travel Guide, in Klee's mind her incredible mother can do anything.\\nWhether it's the way she used to guide Klee step-by-step through the techniques for adding gunpowder and selecting fuses, or the encouragement she'd give Klee to express her creativity through ever-bolder and more beautiful fireworks...\\nOr that time she taught her how to identify Starsnatch Cliff's load-bearing points, then place explosive charges accordingly to bring the whole thing down...\\nOr that time they stuck their tongues out at each other awkwardly while being told off by Huffman of the Knights of Favonius...\\nKlee has many treasured memories of her mother.\\nThis was the way things were until her parents left to travel to somewhere dangerous and far away. They entrusted Klee to the care of Albedo and the Knights of Favonius.\\nThough still small, Klee knew she would one day become just like her mother.\\nOne day, her explosives would become something that her mother would be proud of.",
            "\"Dodoco\"\tDodoco is Klee's first friend, and one of her best.\\nA very long time ago, her mother made this doll for her by hand.\\nAlice affixed it to Klee's four-leaf clover, and hung on her big backpack.\\nFrom that day forth, Klee and Dodoco became inseparable.\\nHer mother said that this would ensure that Klee would never be lonely and that she would have a friend to confide in even when she was alone.\\nThey would also protect each other in times of danger, just like Amber and Baron Bunny.\\nThis, however, caused the Knights no need of worry — considering the other things Alice and her daughter had invented, perhaps this, too, might explode at any time...\\n\"Dodoco\" is a name Klee picked herself.\\nWhen asked what this name meant, she flushed red for a good long while before replying: \"It means... Klee's best friend!\"",
            "Vision\tAsking Klee how she obtained a Vision will probably get you nowhere — she doesn't know, either.\\nA natural-born pyromaniac, Klee had already been acknowledged by a Vision from a very young age.\\nAccording to Klee herself, she had been creating a bomb that was \"even bigger than super big!\"\\nThis was her very first solo project, but the results were far from expected—\\nWell, she \"only\" blew her small workshop sky high, leaving a mountain of smoking ash.\\nBut rather than being disappointed, Klee was pleasantly surprised to see a flaming Vision emerge from those ashes.\\nHow did Klee receive this divine acknowledgment?\\nWas it her talent and passion for explosives, the individualistic nature she got from her mother, or her shining innocence?\\nRegardless, Klee had already obtained such a coveted item at a tender, carefree age.\\nRegardless of what she faces as she grows up, she will never give this \"present\" up."

            "Character Details\tThe librarian of the Knights of Favonius. In addition to her elegance and charm, Lisa is also highly educated.\\nShe is said to have been the most talented sorceress to study at the Sumeru Academia in the last two centuries.\\nIt is known that Lisa chose to return to Mondstadt after two years of advanced study in Sumeru, but the reason for her decision is not.",
            "Character Story 1\tLisa is tasked with managing and maintaining the vast collection of books in the Knights of Favonius library, as well as ensuring that their potions are always fully stocked.\\nThe only time that the citizens of Mondstadt see Lisa is when lending or returning library books.\\nIn both scenarios, they tend to encounter Lisa sitting at the counter like a languid cat, yawning as she signs books in and out.\\nAt times, her behavior causes people to doubt whether she is really up to the task of being librarian for the illustrious Knights of Favonius.\\nNevertheless, it appears that she performs every task flawlessly, as her work consistently stands up to scrutiny.",
            "Character Story 2\tThe fact that Cyrus of the Sumeru Academia frequently refers to Lisa as their \"best student in two hundred years\" is all that needs to be said about Lisa's accomplishments in her studies.\\nFrom outlandish forbidden knowledge, to the handling of elementally infused flora, to the most efficient methods of distilling wine... where there is a body of knowledge, the chances are that Lisa is acquainted with it.\\nThis, paired with her ability to explain things clearly and concisely, makes Lisa the sensible person to approach for young knights and alchemists with burning questions.\\nThat is, provided they go and see her at an acceptable hour.\\nTo visit during unacceptable hours — such as in the morning while Lisa is sleeping in, or in the afternoon while she's enjoying her tea — can spell disaster for unsuspecting visitors.",
            "Character Story 3\tWhen people meet Lisa for the first time, they often find themselves overawed by the famous alumnus of Sumeru Academia.\\nHowever, though her attitude to life may appear at first to be one of ruthless efficiency, it is in fact better understood as a product of her incorrigibly lazy nature, which drives her to avoid troublesome issues at all costs.\\nBy negotiating with Kaeya, she offloaded the job of restocking and dispensing medication to Huffman and Swan, and had Flora start sending Donna over to deliver herbs on a daily basis.\\nThe only tasks that Lisa handles personally are the categorization and management of books and other documents.\\nThis is the one area where Lisa feels more comfortable handling the work herself rather than delegating it.",
            "Character Story 4\tWhen Lisa first joined the Knights of Favonius, the Grand Master sought to appoint her as Captain of the 8th Company.\\nThis was much to the consternation of the company's Field Officer, Nymph, who resented the idea of an academic coming in at such a high-ranking position.\\nAt Kaeya's suggestion, a practice combat session was arranged in which Lisa and Nymph would both display their magical proficiency.\\nTwo minutes into the session, Lisa graciously declined the captaincy on the grounds that \"Nymph manifestly possesses the requisite ability to fulfill the role.\"\\nFor the whole year following, the Grand Master received a constant stream of referral letters from Nymph in relation to the captaincy, and the only person ever named in them was Lisa Minci.\\nEventually, the Grand Master began turning over the referral letters to Lisa directly, but every time, Lisa would come up with an excuse to decline the offer.\\nUndoubtedly, the 8th Company would have been far stronger under her lead, but she deemed that such a level of power was not only superfluous to requirements, it would also be risky for her in a way that most people could never appreciate.\\nTo be clear, Lisa is quite confident that she could handle any situation she came up against. However, additional danger means an additional workload — and that is something that she would never be able to accept.",
            "Character Story 5\tHaving personally witnessed raving-mad scholars in the forests of Sumeru and powerful sages sitting underutilized on advisory councils, Lisa realized what uninhibited erudition can really do to a person.\\nIt seemed such a high price to pay... How much did one have to sacrifice to attain the profoundest knowledge of all?\\nPut off by this realization, Lisa decided to leave Sumeru.\\nSince then, Lisa has always stopped short of taking things too seriously.\\n\"Before demanding too many miracles from the gods, first consider if you are willing to pay the price they ask.\"\\nThese words she has spoken to just three people since arriving in Mondstadt. In each case, it was because she knew it was what they needed to hear.",
            "Special Heating Cauldron\tThe Special Heating Cauldron is a purpose-built cauldron made to a design that no one in Mondstadt could understand. It features time-delay heating, semi-automated ingredient insertion, and temperature regulation functions.\\nLisa spent an enormous budget and commandeered the alchemy workshop for two full weeks in order to build this extraordinary piece of equipment.\\nShe boasts that the cauldron is capable of completing any precision heating task to perfection with a maximum of just two pulls of a lever.\\nBut her most common application for it is to brew tea and keep it at the optimal temperature while she is managing her books.\\nAfter all, a relaxing afternoon tea session is by far the most important part of Lisa's day.",
            "Vision\tA Vision is a sign from the gods: a sign that you are one of those whom they have chosen to change the world.\\nOr, maybe it's just one of the many hoops that one has to jump through on the path to unearthing the secrets of magecraft.\\nAfter all, understanding the elements is essential to the study of magic, and practical experience is a far more useful means of acquiring this understanding than trying to assimilate the knowledge contained in dusty old books.\\n\"Hmm... I suppose I shall need a Vision, then.\"\\nAnd just like that, as that thought popped into her mind, her Vision popped into her hand.\\nWith the aid of her Vision, Lisa acquired the knowledge that she sought. But she also sensed the deep secret hidden in the shadows of that knowledge.\\nFor whatever reason, the gods gave humans the key to changing everything, but they did not explain the cost involved. Lisa grew fearful of the truth.\\nThe Vision that hung from her neck became to her a bottomless pit filled with sweet delights, lingering at the back of her mind.\\nSo, from time to time, when somebody whom she finds interesting comes along, Lisa will pass onto them her understanding on all kinds of matters.\\nPerhaps she is secretly hoping that by doing so, one day someone will come along who has the ability to understand the ultimate truth behind Visions."

Or so Mona will insist.\\nTeyvat is a place where people of all sorts go about their business, and even an enigmatic astrologist must look to hers.\\n—That said, it seems like bards might be the exception to this rule.",
            "Character Story 1\tRecently, Mona's teacher, an old but highly skilled female astrologist, has entrusted a very important task to her.\\nHer teacher has an erstwhile rival-friend in Mondstadt, and she wanted Mona to retrieve a highly confidential box from that person's successor.\\n\"If you dare look inside that books... Well, you'll see.\"\\nThat was the warning Mona received before departing.\\nTo Mona's surprise, this successor was none other than the Spark Knight, Klee.\\nThe box was still extant, but due to Klee's actions and a series of accidents... Mona unwittingly unraveled the enigma behind the box.\\n\"I—I'm done for. The thing inside this was the dark history of her youth... she will kill me if I go back like this...\"\\nMona was thus forced to stay in Mondstadt, beginning a bitterly frugal but bountifully fulfilling existence.",
            "Character Story 2\tMona's astrology utilizes hydromancy, and she once explained the underlying principles thusly:\\n\"It is people's fate that shines in the night sky, and though its reflection in water is but an illusion, it reveals the truth nonetheless.\"\\nNo one else can quite comprehend this principle, but Mona's ability convinces people to believe in it anyway.\\nAlbeit, sometimes grudgingly...\\nHer astrological readings are exceptionally precise, and she will neither lie nor hold anything back when revealing the results of her readings.\\n\"Your son says that he's made it. That's a lie.\"\\n\"You've got no chance with him. In fact, he will soon leave you.\"\\nThe cold, hard truth is laid bare before people' eyes, complete with all the grisly details that they would rather remained buried.\\nMona will make no exceptions to this, and as such she can seem completely lacking in human emotion.\\nBut sometimes, on a clear night, she can be seen on a high mountain slope.\\nThere, Mona gazes up at the stars in the sky — so close, she feels, that she could almost reach out and touch them — with gentle eyes, humming an unknown tune to herself.",
            "Character Story 3\tHaving never studied the art of finance, the astrologist Mona is always hovering around the poverty line.\\nIn order to save on food expenses, she once ate mushrooms for an entire month straight. If not for some relief funds coming from time to time, she would have had trouble eking out a living.\\nMona does in fact have some money set aside. Even though she must eventually run dry without an income, she can slow the bleeding by scrimping in the food department.\\nSo where does the rest of the Mora go? Well, if you've ever had a look inside her lab, then know that the big pile of astrology-related apparatus and tools in there didn't come out of thin air.\\nIn fact, all of them come with a hefty price tag — books from Liyue, an astrolabe from Sumeru... The shipping fees alone are impressive.\\nThat Mona should be in abject poverty comes, therefore, as no surprise.\\nIn order to support herself, Mona eventually took up a commercial contract — her contributions to a column about constellation in The Steambird have become her most stable income source.\\nNow having a monthly income, Mona could have left her life of poverty. But how could an astrologist's pursuit of knowledge end here?\\nWhenever she gets paid, Mona will immediately shell out on more astrology-related resources, returning to a state of destitution once more.\\nThis process plays out every month.\\nToday, too, is another day Mona worries over Mora.",

The techniques passed down to me are exceptional, of course, but my teacher is not my equal.\\nDoes she know the market rates for eggs, butter, or wheat? In this regard, I have already far surpassed her.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tDuring her apprenticeship, Mona found that the subtle abstractions of her master's teachings could explain the laws that governed the existence of all things.\\nHuman hearts were guided by these laws, and if one had great enough powers of calculation, all the mysteries of the world could be understood.\\nMona once believed this to be true.\\nBut when she had to strike out on her own and live day-to-day, she found herself doubting.\\nNot everyone lived wealthy and comfortable lives. Some neither had food nor warm clothes, living no differently from beggars.\\nAnd it was just such an adventurer who, when meeting Mona while she was out looking for fruits and vegetables to fill her stomach, shared half their food with her.\\n\"Out here, we've gotta have each other's backs.\"\\nThis was not something inscribed on these so-called principles of the world. And many other such things she encountered on her journey — the honesty of a thief, a robber's change of heart, a coward's courage, the good deeds of a wicked person...\\nMona began to have some doubts, but she also felt like she finally had her feet on solid ground.\\nWhen she was again alone with her thoughts under the stars, she marveled that her research had been so full of holes.\\nPerhaps she would have to continue researching the world's principles for the rest of her life.",

That she had this opportunity at all was pure chance.\\nWhen the previous contributing author was traveling the world, he heard tell of a strange astrologist, and his hobbyist's curiosity compelled him to seek her out.\\nTheir correspondence left him deeply impressed.\\nAs it happened, he was also looking to retire, and seeing that Mona was strapped for Mora, reached out to help her by recommending her to the editor-in-chief of The Steambird.\\nWhen Mona released her first column, \"An Introduction to Astrology,\" the column, heretofore known for being easy reading, experienced a massive shift in tone.\\nMost of each issue was dedicated to discussing the movement of celestial bodies and other difficult (and obscure) topics. Academic quotations, dense footnotes and even the occasional hand-drawn star maps abounded in these writings.\\nThe editor-in-chief could not help but feel worried that this approach was too academic. Would it find acceptance with long-time readers? As it turned out, there was no need to fret. The publishing house received a great many letters that read something like this:\\n\"Wow, this is amazing. I don't really get it, but this is super interesting. Consider me a fan of Astrologist Mona Megistus.\"\\nAfter getting approval to continue submitting manuscripts, Mona could finally heave a sigh of relief.\\nNow, how best to celebrate... Ah yes.

Mona seeks the final truth of the world, hidden amidst the sea of stars.\\nAs such, she does not have any reverence for her Vision, which the people of this world consider to be a sign of divine favor and the source of all power.\\nNonetheless, this item that serves no practical use in her hands is something that she treasures greatly.\\nIt was gifted to her by her teacher as a teaching aid, and it is the only evidence of their time together as master and pupil.\\nShe preserves these distant memories with great care.

            "Character Details\tThe \"Liyue Qixing\" controls all of the commerce that takes place in Liyue Harbor. Its highly-revered position is also coveted by many. Their primary ruling is to play things safe and keep a low profile.\\nThe \"Tianquan\" of the Qixing, Ningguang, is the only exception. \\nShe is seen as an excellent merchant in the eyes of her rivals, a friendly elder sister to kids, a socialite at the banquets of Yujing Terrace, and a connoisseur of desserts... Ningguang is the talk of the town, and everyone seems to know everything about her. However, they all seem to tell a different story of Ningguang, with great discrepancies between the versions.\\nStill, if there's one thing all the rumors about her agree on, it's that Ningguang is someone truly extraordinary.",
            "Character Story 1\tUp above Liyue Harbor, there is a floating palace held up by plaustrite. It is known as the \"Jade Chamber,\" and it belongs to Ningguang.\\nOn a clear day, one can see almost all of Liyue Harbor from the decks outside the palace gates.\\nWhenever Ningguang has important business matters to handle, she invariably comes to this floating palace. She strictly forbids anyone from accessing the premises except for her three trusted confidants. Her confidants sort through the relevant information, summarize it and hang the summaries on the wall, while Ningguang rests against the railings, enjoying the view of Liyue and quietly mulling everything over.\\nShe is certain to arrive at the perfect solution before her confidants have finished adding everything to the wall. Once she has made her decision she shreds everything and throws it out of the window, creating something of a snowstorm of paper.\\nThe handwriting on the shredded pieces of paper stands out like ink in the snow to all of the merchants in Liyue Harbor.\\nFor they know that whenever Ningguang's shredded snow falls, a huge change is about to descend on the business community.",
            "Character Story 2\t\"Ningguang knows everything,\" foreigners will often find the Liyue locals warning them.\\nLoophole-hunting guilds, market-manipulating hoarders, smugglers coming ashore with their illicit goods... The Tianquan knows all the details, good, bad and ugly.\\nOnce, an alchemist from Sumeru was traveling in Liyue and unwittingly happened across the records of a certain noctilucous jade transaction involving the Blackcliff Forge ten years prior. That night, someone from Ningguang's inner circle knocked on his window and invited him to join Ningguang in the Jade Chamber for a talk.\\nRumor has it that Ningguang has enchanted the Jade Chamber in such a way that allows her to eavesdrop on everyone in the city's private conversations...\\nThe truth is that Ningguang's eyes and ears are in fact the children who play on the streets in Liyue Harbor.\\nBetween them, they are aware of every confidential meeting, every private conversation, and every new visitor to the city. When Ningguang gathers them around, her promise of delicious treats proves to be an irresistible incentive, and so they tell her everything they know.\\nOnce she has finished carefully cross-referencing everything she has learned from the children against other sources, there is no secret hidden from her in Liyue Harbor.\\nShe understands the value of reciprocity more than anyone, which is why she is more than willing to invest time in mingling with the common folk.\\nOn top of that, she does actually like seeing the children smile.",
            "Character Story 3\tNingguang's attitude to making money is largely the same as anyone else's: you can never have enough.\\nBut money to her is more than just a sign of wealth — each Mora is a trophy of a hard-won victory.\\nNingguang is kind and friendly toward the common folk, but this is a side of her that none of her business associates could ever hope to see.\\nTo her, the business world is a playground, and the zero-sum games are the most exciting. Each round she wins against a wealthy merchant brings a gleeful smile to her face as they sigh and reluctantly hand over the Mora, and nothing makes her happier than seeing the guilds bow to her wishes.\\nEvery victory in this game adds to the wealth of the Liyue Qixing. Liyue Harbor prospers as a result, and this in turn creates more business opportunities and more profit for Ningguang. Every member of the Liyue Qixing is more than happy with this perfect cycle of interlocking interests.\\nPeople often ask Ningguang why she is still doing business in Liyue Harbor when she has already acquired such vast wealth.\\n\"Vast wealth is a wonderful thing.\"\\nNingguang patiently replies, never able to understand why people would ask such foolish questions.\\n\"Adding another Mora to the pot can hardly make it any less wonderful, now, can it?\"",
            "Character Story 4\tEveryone living in Liyue Harbor has to abide by the rules. Those who do so will see their interests protected, while those who violate the rules will be punished accordingly.\\nThe rules are rooted in ancient laws set down by Morax, Liyue Harbor's divine protector, and they are absolute. Over the millennia, each Tianquan has introduced amendments to the rules to ensure they are well aligned with current societal needs.\\nThe laws are compiled and published along with a 279-page commentary, and a copy is given to each citizen of Liyue.\\nNingguang likes it this way: Law and order is good for business, and she understands the intricacies of the laws that forge the order better than anyone else.\\nHowever, there was a certain ship captain by the name of Beidou who acted with flagrant disregard for the rules, smuggling contraband goods by leveraging her exotic cargo and exclusive business intelligence. To Ningguang, captain Beidou was the black sheep of Liyue Harbor's business community.\\nAs Tianquan, it fell to Ningguang to impose heavy fines on Beidou each time she transgressed the rules. But much to her consternation, Beidou seemed to take these fines in her stride, like water off a duck's back.\\nOutside of the official channels, too, Ningguang tried to find ways to implore Beidou to change her ways and stop putting the Qixing in such a difficult position. In response, Beidou simply explained away her actions as \"enacting justice,\" \"helping the poor\" and \"keeping the sailors in their jobs.\" As a firm believer in the principle of live and let live, Beidou had no time for Ningguang's advice.\\nIn the end, Ningguang agreed to disagree and gave up trying to convince the stubborn Beidou to change.",
            "Character Story 5\tBeing the charming and wealthy woman that she is, Ningguang has never had a shortage of suitors.\\nIt seems that every eligible bachelor, from the young esquires of Yujing Terrace, to accomplished young businessmen, to renowned sea captains, has at some point invested substantial energy into trying to win Ningguang's affection. One rumor even has it that a wealthy businessman from the Court of Fontaine signed a major trade deal with Liyue Harbor for the sole reason that it would mean he could see Ningguang more often.\\nNingguang treats all her suitors with an equal measure of kindness and grace, but also keeps them at distance — enough to keep them interested but not push them away. Curiosity got the better of everyone in town, and now everyone wants to know: Who is Ningguang's lover? \\nLittle do they know, Ningguang has no love for finite things, and will certainly not be bound by something that is finite.\\nThe Jade Chamber, a floating palace above Liyue Harbor, belongs to Ningguang alone. It started out about the size of a room, but has since grown so large that in the moonlight it casts its shadow over the whole of Liyue.\\nA portion of Ningguang's seemingly limitless wealth goes towards hiring skilled craftsmen to continue the expansion and refurbishment of the Jade Chamber, ensuring that it becomes ever more extravagant as time goes by.\\nTo Ningguang, the Jade Chamber is a symbol of her wealth and power, and a sign that her business is flourishing.\\nSave for Mora, it is the thing Ningguang loves most in the world — because it is infinite.\\nOne day, she insists, it will cast its shadow over all the seven nations of Teyvat.",
            "Chess Game: Liyue Millennial\tNingguang invented a form of chess to pass the time.\\nThis chessboard not only contains to-scale reproductions of Liyue Harbor's natural and urban geography, vendors, tea houses, shops, hotels and miscellaneous stores, but it also contains six, ten and twelve-sided dice (among others.) Players use the dice to determine how far their chess pieces move, and landing on various locations will trigger different events. Victory in-game is decided by the number of counters in each player's hands.\\nThe rules can change at any time according to Ningguang's fancies, and when playing with others, she will always follow the newest rule set that she has on hand.\\nWhen she's truly feeling the spirit, she will even design new rules on the spot — no one has yet beaten her at this game, and she has now reached the 32.6th edition of her rulebook.\\nShe marketed the 8th edition of the game to the general public, believing it to be the easiest to understand, but it proved to still be far too complicated for ordinary folk.\\nNonetheless, people flock to purchase sets on account of the beauty and intricacy of the model pieces.\\nIn truth, more people buy it for the models than for the game.",
            "Vision\tNo one knows how Visions are created — they have always seemed to just appear out of thin air, leaving the countless unacknowledged in the lurch without a clue as to how to get one.\\nAs for Visions left behind after their users die, they are masterless husks without any elemental power, nor is any method of reawakening them known, save for a tiny chance that it may resonate with another — and only one such \"other\" at a time...\\nNingguang's first thought upon seeing such an object a subconscious \"oh, look, a new business opportunity.\"\\nPutting this up for sale would surely have the rich shelling out for it. And if they can't resonate with it, why, they'll just use it to keep up appearances. A sound call either way...\\nAnd if there should be a way to collect such empty shells, could this not become a long term business?\\nPlaying with the jewel in one hand, Ningguang began writing plans for an auction in the other, her smile widening as she thought about the riches to be had — and at that moment, the Vision shone forth its light.\\nNingguang's smile froze as the Vision activated.\\nHer attendants, coming upon the sight of their mistress, awakened Vision in hand, began to congratulate her on having obtained a priceless treasure.\\nNingguang, for her part, seemed annoyed instead.\\n\"What's there to be happy about? Once broken, considered sold!\""

            "About Noelle: Discipline\tIn my job, I do the exact same things every day — a far cry from being a true knight, that's for sure. But ultimately, this is all part of my training, and when it comes to training, actions speak louder than words.",
            "About Noelle: Disagreement\tI'm a bit useless in an argument because I can't really explain my reasoning clearly.

All I try to do is convince people with results instead of trying to talk them round... Is that really stubborn of me?",

            "About Klee\tI've always been curious as to how she managed to become a fully-fledged knight at such a young age. I actually went to ask her for tips once, but I'd barely started talking to her when she grabbed me by the hand and took me outside the Knights headquarters to play with bombs. I thought it was some kind of training exercise at first, but Jean found us, and we both ended up in solitary confinement...",
            "About Jean\tMaster Jean has always been my role model, both in terms of ability and dedication.

Until then, there's no room for complacency!",
            "About Varka\tAt first I wanted to join his expedition party and do my part as a maid. But the Grand Master said no — it would give him more peace of mind if I stayed behind to take care of things in Mondstadt. It made me so happy to hear how much he values me! ...Okay, so apparently he said the same thing to a lot of people. But that doesn't change the fact he prizes me too!",

Okay, well yes, technically I run errands for him. But still, I really appreciate it!",

No, I simply cannot accept his offer.",
            "About Fischl: Tea\tI think she's from another world, but I don't know the details. One thing I do know, however, is that she loves the Knights of Favonius' library. She can always be found there with her nose in a book. I bring her some refreshments whenever I go in there to clean, and she always thanks me profusely. When I say profusely... I mean she goes a bit over the top, to be honest, and... I actually don't understand half of what she's saying.",

            "Character Details\tNoelle has much greater dreams and ambitions than other maids in the Knights of Favonius.\\nLike anyone else in this city protected by the Knights of Favonius, she too dreams of donning the honored armor.\\nEven if her skills are not enough to pass the rigorous selection trials, she still wishes to observe and learn from them every chance she gets.\\nAside from her training, she enjoys her current life, helping everyone in need.\\n\"You can leave absolutely anything to me!\"\\nThat's her signature line. If there's anything that you need, Noelle is glad to be of aid.",
            "Character Story 1\tNoelle is \"the maid of all maids\" to many.\\nSuch people also tend to say this of her: \"She's everywhere.\"\\nFor example, there was a child who once tried to get a plate during a banquet, but found that there was no way to open the cabinet without all the plates falling out...\\n\"Noelle!!!!!!\"\\nAll the child needed to do was scream, and Noelle appeared. She put the cabinet down on its back, took a plate out, and handed it to the child, reminding him not to have cold drinks immediately after having barbecue. Then she righted the cabinet, cleaned up other plates, and then put them back in order.\\nNoelle's ability to be everywhere all at once is something miraculous to many.\\nHowever, the job of a maid is no myth or legend. Noelle only does her job to the letter.\\n\"No more, no less. As it should be, not as it should not be.\"\\nNoelle doesn't think herself special, only that she thinks too much at times.",
            "Character Story 2\tNoelle is always eager to help, sometimes excessively so.\\nIf you were to ask her how to build a campfire as she passed by, she would not only stop and build the campfire for you, she would also put up the grill racks, season the food, cook it for you, taste it herself to make sure it's done, and remind you to put out the fire when you've finished so as not to burn the forest down. Then she would get back to whatever she had been doing beforehand.\\nOf course, most people don't mind at all that she regularly goes the extra mile. But it can sometimes produce unexpected results...\\nFor example, a merchant from Snezhnaya once came to Mondstadt, ostensibly wishing to get into the winery business. In truth, he had an evil plot to ruin the land, destroy the winery business in Mondstadt altogether and then seize the market with wines from Snezhnaya.\\nHe disguised himself as an honest merchant with his family on a business trip to Mondstadt. Naturally, with them being visitors from afar, Noelle gave them a warm reception.\\nInitially, the merchant was delighted with Noelle's hospitality; it was a cut above the crude etiquette he had come to expect from most peasants in Mondstadt. However, after a while he began to feel that something was amiss.\\nNoelle seemed to be able to read his mind: She correctly guessed his schedule, cooked his family's favorite Snezhnayan dishes for them each day, and even knew that his daughter liked to go to bed hugging a ragdoll, presenting her with a hand-made doll she had sewn together herself.\\nThis spooked the merchant, and made him hesitant to execute the next phase of his plan. Noelle's warm smile now chilled the merchant to the bone. What else did she know, and what was she really planning?\\nIn the end, the merchant fled Mondstadt with his family.\\nNoelle was upset for a few days, thinking she had somehow insulted her guests. Little did she know that all of Mondstadt was indebted to her for taking her job so seriously.",
            "Character Story 3\tMost of the time, Noelle's reliability provides a comforting presence, but there are always exceptions.\\nOnce, she learned that an adventurer was trapped on Dragonspine, so she decided to mount a rescue by herself.\\nThe snowstorm that day was terribly fierce, wiping out any tracks left by humans as soon as they were made. It was impossible to find a safe route to proceed, to say nothing of saving the adventurer amidst the snow.\\nHowever, Noelle persisted on searching for the adventurer and eventually found him inside a cave, suffering from severe hypothermia.\\nAt the time, her coat was completely soaked, and the water inside her bottle had turned to ice. Thirsty and hungry, Noelle still managed to carry the adventurer down on her back.\\nThe adventurer was saved, but Noelle, having over-exerted herself, laid in bed for three days straight, suffering from a high fever. Everyone in the Knights of Favonius barely slept out of concern for her during that period. Fortunately, Noelle recovered.\\nIt was not the first or second time that something similar had happened, and everyone was deeply worried for Noelle.\\nIn order to prevent Noelle from putting herself in harm's way again, Jean had to invent some safe jobs to keep Noelle busy. If something were to happen, then Kaeya would have to save the day.\\nDuring the Stormterror threat, Noelle was also eager to resolve the threat at its source. However, Kaeya managed to arrange quite a few \"urgent matters\" for her to attend to inside the city until it was all over.",
            "Character Story 4\tNoelle's petite form does a good job of hiding her great strength.\\nThis does not just refer to her resoluteness or her indomitable spirit, but also her physical strength.\\nOnce, Lisa accidentally dropped her experimental apparatus under her bookshelf and troubled over whether she could remain decent while bending over to retrieve it. Noelle made it over in the nick of time, lifting the full bookshelf with only one hand — and not a single book fell out between her hefting it and putting it down.\\nThere was another incident in which several cargo-bearing carts were attacked by Pyro Slimes as they tried to pass through Mondstadt's side gate. As the owners were all in a panic, it was Noelle again who came to the rescue — hurling the carts — cargo and all, into the Cider Lake, before leaping into the water herself and retrieving every last item.\\nRumor has it that when Noelle was studying the blade, she nearly sent Wagner — who prided himself in his forging skills — into despairing seclusion.\\nIn all, he forged over ten different swords with different alloy compositions for Noelle, but all would lose their edge after a few uses.\\nAt first, Wagner thought Noelle unskilled, but eventually found that the problem was more foundational: the swords just weren't strong enough.\\nPutting his reputation on the line, Wagner finally made Noelle a sturdy and heavy claymore that was further reinforced by her affinity for Geo. Only then was her weapon issue (barely) solved.\\nBut don't worry, Noelle won't use her superhuman strength unless the situation calls for it, as she is a pacifist at heart.\\nThey say, however, that the very day Noelle received her custom-made claymore, she was set upon by a pair of drunken Treasure Hoarders in Drunkard Gorge, who thought her a harmless lamb...\\nLet's just hope that no one else will ever be so unlucky.",
            "Character Story 5\tNoelle's greatest enemy, curiously, is not a person, but Ludi Harpastum itself.\\nDuring Ludi Harpastum, long tables arranged in a circular shape and filled with all kinds of food will be set up in the plaza before the Cathedral for everyone to enjoy.\\nThe food is usually prepared by volunteers who can cook. During this time, Noelle, who always holds herself to a high standard, joins the volunteers in continuously cooking and serving food.\\nIt's not really any additional work; what's difficult is that she insists on tasting every dish to make sure they are up to standard.\\nThe crispy Moon Pies; the sizzling Mondstadt Pork Chops; the towering Pile 'Em Ups — all the fried and barbecued foods, equal parts delicious and fatty, are customary at the festival.\\nThe smiles on people's faces make Noelle truly happy. What makes her less so is seeing her bulging belly. She can't help but let out a sigh.\\nFor the entire month following the festival, Noelle will volunteer for the Knights of Favonius' city night patrol.\\nThe festival may be over, but her battle is only beginning.",
            "\"Warning of Roses\"\tThe maids of the Knights have many \"red lines\" that are not to be crossed, and one of these is that \"the personal information of the Knights must be kept in strict confidence.\"\\nThis does not only require restricting outsider access to such information — this restriction also applies to other members of the Knights.\\nFor example, what Jean keeps in her private quarters, the contents of Amber's Baron Bunny, the number of special eye patches that Kaeya owns, the number of Klee's hidden bomb caches... These things are all top secret.\\nTo avoid leaking such information, Noelle used red cloth to make a great many roses — in Mondstadt, this flower means \"my lips are sealed.\"\\nShe specially wove one such rose into her gauntlet as an ever-present reminder to herself.\\nRevealing secrets would be a major dereliction of duty for a maid, and those who aspire to be knights cannot afford such errors.\\nSo you can forget about probing Noelle for any secrets. She won't tell.",
            "Vision\tNoelle did once wish to fulfill her dream before its time. Some years ago, after failing her seventh selection test, which was really a foregone conclusion, she felt somewhat discouraged.\\nThe etiquette, swordsmanship, the lines she had memorized... had they all gone to waste? She remembered all the strong points of every official knight, but who would remember the hard work of a failure like her?\\nShe had never stopped aspiring to become a Knight of Favonius, but her exhausted body wouldn't let her get back on her feet like she normally would. She felt like someone who had spent days and nights traveling through an icy tundra.\\nAt that moment, the main gate of the Knights Headquarters were flung upon, and out walked Acting Grand Master Jean, who had just been in charge of the selection process.\\nWithout a thought, Noelle gave a precise knight's salute.\\nImmediately, she knew that this was too abrupt a thing to do, and wondered what Jean might think of her.\\nBut just as she was wishing that there was some hole she might crawl into to flee, Jean stopped in her own tracks and returned the salute.\\nAfter a moment's surprise, Noelle gave a strained smile, clumsy but pure.\\nThis was a lucky day that she would always remember, for she would receive recognition from two all-important sources this day: once from Jean, and the other from the gods.\\nHer hard work had been remembered after all.\\nFrom that day forward, Vision in hand, Noelle reaffirmed her belief that she would one day be able to don that armor. That she would be gentle and reliable — and yes, everywhere at once too."

            "Character Details\tDue to being a zombie, Qiqi lacks facial expression. She hopes that's okay.\\nShe may look like a zombie, but she's surprisingly limber due to a strict calisthenics regimen.\\nHer memory is poor. She forgets easily, and that is partly why she can seem cold to others.\\nHer appearance is forever frozen at the point of her passing, so estimates of her age are unreliable.\\nZombies require orders to act, but due to some reason or another, Qiqi is presently giving herself orders.",
            "Character Story 1\tUsually, zombies are cold and stiff, which forces them to locomote by hopping about.\\nAs such, Qiqi keeps up a calisthenics regimen to retain a human-like form.\\nThe 77th-generation Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, Hu Tao, doesn't see the point of all this. Whenever she meets Qiqi, she will say: \"It would be easier if you just let me bury you.\"\\nQiqi, of course, has no wish to be buried, and so conducts her exercises at night when no one's about.\\nQiqi's memory falls far behind those of non-undead disposition.\\nIf she does not continue to reinforce her impressions of someone, she will completely forget them in three days tops.\\nBut who knows, this might be a good thing — for a person with painful memories, forgetting may, in fact, be a form of release.\\nThe person Qiqi must remember most... not only does this person have a very punch-able face, but she also shows up every single day.\\nAs such, Qiqi isn't too concerned about her poor memory.",
            "Character Story 2\tQiqi is very petite indeed, but is in fact a very powerful zombie. Her short stature is hardly any impediment, but is instead good for high-speed movement.\\nIn combat, Qiqi will unleash the self-control that she usually maintains, allowing her body to return to an undead state, increasing her strength and speed.\\n\"You're dead.\"\\nOnce she has stoically defeated her enemies, Qiqi will once again get her muscles under control, returning to her normal state.\\nShe has been threatened in the past by Treasure Hoarders while picking herbs by herself.\\nNow, a little girl, all by herself, seems like an easy target, no?\\nWho would have thought that this girl could send a whole crew flying?\\nThis is why we should always remember never to judge a person based on appearances. Or a zombie, for that matter.",
            "Character Story 3\tZombies mostly require orders from the person who awakens them to move. But strictly speaking, Qiqi has never been awakened.\\nAs such, she counts as a very rare case of a zombie that gives itself orders.\\nIf these orders are simple ones like \"defeat the enemy,\" Qiqi has no problem fulfilling them.\\nBut when faced with complex instructions such as \"go to Jueyun Karst, climb the sheer rock faces and pick herbs,\" Qiqi sometimes winds up stuck below the cliffs, unable to give up no matter how many times she tries and fails to scale the cliff.\\nThe method to cancel her orders is very simple — hug Qiqi from behind, tell her something like \"I love you the most,\" and the orders will dissipate, just like that.\\nUnfortunately, there's just no element of sincerity when Baizhu does it, leading to greatly reduced results.\\nPerhaps someday, someone will come along who understands that such words cannot be spoken lightly, and who slowly but carefully releases the hold that Qiqi's orders have over her...\\nWhat will Qiqi's response be then?",
            "Character Story 4\tThis ancient story has long been forgotten by mortals.\\nAn ordinary herb-picking lass named Qiqi lost her way and trespassed the realm of the adepti. Injuring her right leg in a fall, she hurriedly hid in a cavern to rest.\\nEven occupied as she was in bandaging her wound, she could hear sounds that did not belong to the mortal plane. But she could have never expected that with a huge crash, she would forever be trapped between life and death.\\nWhether adepti or demons, just or wicked, all understood that she was an innocent mortal caught in the crossfire.\\nOr perhaps it was by the will of heaven that she received a Vision in her dying moments, and so ended this contention between adepti and demon.\\nThe adepti could not bear to let her die, and each imparted to her a portion of their strength, meaning to breathe life back into her body.\\nQiqi did indeed awaken and live again, but went into a berserk state, unable to control the adepti energy raging through her.\\nSeeking to end the disturbance, Mountain Shaper had no choice but to seal the hapless maiden in amber.",
            "Character Story 5\tAfter hundreds of years, Qiqi was discovered by humans, still trapped in the amber, and was brought to Wangsheng Funeral Parlor for burial.\\nThe mountain roads were treacherous, however, and the amber was bumped about. Coupled with the passing of many years, the seal on Qiqi was all but spent.\\nShe awakened in the middle of the night, broke the amber in secret, and fled.\\nFollowing the herb-picking habits of her previous life, Qiqi headed right for the hills.\\nBy chance, she met Baizhu, the boss of Bubu Pharmacy, on the way, and he took her in.\\nNow, Baizhu was a doctor of great skill, but he was hardly a man of high caliber or great courage.\\nEven so, he took her in, never mind that her memory was so poor that she could not even sort herbs out.\\nIt does seem that his acceptance of Qiqi has something to do with his own personal pursuits.\\nQiqi is stiff, but not slow, and has long realized this.

            "Vision\tQiqi's Vision was given to her in the last moment of her life.\\nShe wanted to stop the clock from turning. She wanted to live happily again.\\nShe feared death.

How wonderful would that be?\"\\nAs she thought thus, tears fell from the moribund girl's eyes upon the Vision that had appeared before her.\\nThe mighty and illuminated adepti all acknowledged this as a legitimate form of \"illumination\" — the yearning of humanity for bygone days is, after all, a desire to protect that past."

            "Character Details\tRazor is a boy whose identity is shrouded in mystery. He lives in Wolvendom and is rarely spotted by the citizens of Mondstadt.\\nAccording to a handful of eyewitness accounts, Razor has keen senses and is highly agile, traversing the forest at breakneck speed. He is often seen in the company of his wolf pack, while generally avoiding contact with humans.\\nSome speculate that he was an orphan raised by the wolves, while others say he is a wolf spirit that has taken on a human form.\\nSuch rumors only add to the mystery of the \"Wolf Boy,\" as the denizens of Mondstadt call him.\\nMeanwhile, Razor the Wolf Boy stands all the while on the hilltops with his head held high, basking in the warm sunlight.",
            "Character Story 1\tRazor lives among the wolves night and day.\\nAll of them are as close with Razor as they could possibly be. Which wolf has the loudest howl, which wolf runs the fastest, which wolf is the best at ambushing — there isn't a wolf Razor doesn't know.\\nHe can sense the mood of the wind, smell a scent from miles away, and knows many practical applications for plants of all kinds. The one thing he can't bring to mind is the faces of his parents.\\nWhat kind of people were they? No matter how hard he tries, he cannot remember.\\nHis memory starts after his life with the wolves had already begun. The wolves took him in as part of their \"Lupical\" — a word he was taught by someone else, which means family.",
            "Character Story 2\tTiny singing things are flying in the sky.\\nThe clouds are long and fluffy, like a wolf's tail.\\nRazor's world is a simple one.\\nOn a sunny day, you run around hunting or try and beat your prey to the ripe fruits, on a rainy day, you hide out in a hollow tree and fall asleep hugging a furry lupine friend, with some grass and leaves for a pillow.\\nEat as much as you can and drink plenty of water. Cool off in the lake when you're hot, and go find some juicy berries when you're thirsty.\\nRazor looks at his body and then at the bodies of his kin.\\nHe knows he is different from them.\\nBut there's nothing wrong with that, as far as Razor is concerned.",
            "Character Story 3\tOne day, a tall man came to the mountains and disrupted Razor's peaceful life.\\nRazor did not know who the man was, only that he was a human. Seeing the confused look on Razor's face, the man gave him a friendly smile.\\n\"Hey buddy! Why don't you come back down to Mondstadt with me?\"\\nThe man offered his hand to Razor as he spoke.\\nBut neither Razor nor the wolves understood the gesture. Feeling protective, the wolves placed themselves between Razor and the man to keep him away.\\nRazor ducked down beneath the wolves' furry tails. He looked at his body, and then peered out through the gaps in the wolf fur to get a look at the man's.\\nRazor knew he wasn't the most intelligent of beings, and was at a loss to answer the question that has been in his mind ever since that day.\\n\"Am I a human, or a wolf?\"",
            "Character Story 4\tIt was that man who gave Razor his name.\\nThe simple Wolf Boy could not understand the intricacies of human language, but he knew from the look on the man's face when he produced this sound that the man was giving him a name.\\n\"Rae-zer.\"\\nThe shadows cast by the trees of Wolvendom grew short, and then grew long again.\\nThe man taught Razor how to swing a sword. Unwieldy though this steel claw may be, thought Razor, it was at least sharp enough to cut through tree branches.\\n\"Now you can protect your friends.\"\\n\"Fr-ren-dzz...\"\\nRazor imitated the sounds the man made, without understanding what they meant.\\nSimilarly, he did not understand why the names of things were all that important in the first place. After all, he never learned the name of that man before he left.",
            "Character Story 5\t\"Master, what is... 'friends'?\"\\nRazor once asked of his new mentor, working at the limits of his vocabulary.\\nHis purple-clothed mentor seemed to know it all, from how to make hash browns from potatoes in the ground, to the name of the brightest star in the summer night sky.\\nHowever, Lisa simply smiled and yawned without answering him.\\nRazor thought about it when the wind blew, when the rain fell — even when Wolfhook berries got stuck in his fur. He just couldn't figure it out.\\nUntil one day, Razor met a bright-red, 'burny' girl.\\nThey stood in the wind together, got soaked in the rain together — she even rolled around in Wolfhook bushes with him.\\nHer name was Klee. When Razor played with her, it was like being a wolf pup again.\\n\"Friends... is... Lupical.\"\\nRazor may not understand the complexity of human relationships, but he has an honest, primal loyalty to him.\\n\"So... protect friends... Lupical... with life.\"\\nThe wolf pack howls in the distance, summoning him home.\\nRazor still does not know if he is a human or a wolf.\\nBut he is happy either way.",
            "Razor's Crude Wooden Crate\tIn a box so crudely made that one has to be extra careful when opening it lies Razor's greatest treasures.\\nThe broken-off hilt of a greatsword, a children's storybook called The Wolf and the Windwheel Aster, and a dry, withered four-leaf clover.\\nThough he understands neither the intricacies of human relations nor the ways of the world, Razor knows that these are gifts from the ones known as 'friends' — and that is what makes them his most treasured possessions of all.",
            "Vision\tThe story of how Razor got his Vision is one of the few memories that he wishes he could forget.\\nOne day, during a lightning storm, an Abyss Mage ambushed Razor from behind and dragged him away. The wolf pack ran to his aid and put up a fearless fight, but every last one of them was defeated by the Abyss Mage.\\nAs he looked on helplessly at his dear companions being harmed, Razor let out an almighty roar like that of a cornered animal.\\n\"Lupical!\"\\nFueled by his almighty fury, a lightning-like power grew inside, and suddenly an overload of elemental energy was flowing within him.\\nHe was ready to protect. He was ready to avenge.\\nHe threw off his shackles and raised his weapon.\\nThe Abyss Mage was overwhelmed and defeated by a wild, unfettered frenzy of Electro energy, but this time it was too late to save Razor's wolven companions.\\n...\\nThough he had obtained a Vision, Razor was still unable to manipulate Electro energy with finesse. One day many moons later, when he met the Witch of Purple Rose, Lisa, he began to study human knowledge.\\n\"Friends, hurt... Never again! I will... protect them.\"\\nWith each day, Razor grew more skilled in the use of his Vision. He made a silent promise to himself: \"I will become stronger. I will become the strongest of them all.\"\\nBecause the day may come when his Lupical faces another threat, and this time, he will protect them."

            "Character Details\tRosaria is one of the sisters of Mondstadt's Church of Favonius.\\nThough she is just as much a woman of the cloth as the likes of Barbara and Jilliana, people tend to make a mental distinction between Rosaria and other members of the clergy.\\nWhile she might dress the part — at least, to a certain extent — her speech and actions do not reflect her office in the slightest.\\nFurthermore, she displays even less reverence towards the gods than the ordinary citizens, and she routinely skips her various church engagements.\\nShe comes, goes, and acts in solitude, and if she were ever to make an appearance in the Cathedral, it would be to smoke in the rearmost pew.\\nSuch a lone wolf is Rosaria that perhaps she should be considered a clergywoman in name only.",
            "Character Story 1\tIf Rosaria has been lectured once, she has been lectured a thousand times before concerning her unorthodox behavior.\\nFor some reason, however, she has never faced any serious consequences for her transgressions. She does not work together with her church colleagues and only rarely shows up to celebratory events in the city.\\nThe strange and mysterious Rosaria moves about almost like a wisp of black smoke — blink, and you'll miss her as she disappears into thin air.\\nHer social interactions are never more than superficial, and the rest of the time she keeps herself to herself.\\nHowever, Sister Victoria would say that the ever good-natured Barbara is one person who has always made the effort to get close to Rosaria.\\n\"Please don't smoke in the Cathedral...\" \"Could you try to attend the ceremony on time next time...?\"\\n\"And... Hey, come back, I'm still talking to you!\"\\nBarbara is forever anxiously chasing after Rosaria, urging her to complete her various daily tasks.\\nYet even when faced with Barbara, the beloved idol of Mondstadt, Rosaria remains completely unmoved.\\nSurely her heart can't be completely made of stone?",
            "Character Story 2\tRosaria's movements are unpredictable. She often leaves without notifying anyone and can be gone for up to several days on end.\\nDuring these times, none of her church colleagues know where to find her.\\nOne of the sisters who took it upon herself to observe Rosaria once groused that \"even a stray cat should at least give you notice before running off...\"\\nRosaria uses these disappearances to do work that only she can do in corners unseen by others.\\nAn unfamiliar merchant, a suspicious traveler — are these people threats to Mondstadt?\\nShe investigates, shadows, and if necessary, interrogates.\\nIf they must disappear, then Rosaria shall be the last person they meet.\\nSuch dark work, which cannot see the light of day, is to be done by her hand alone.\\nShe always sets out after the sun has set, finishing her work in one fell swoop. Sometimes, if she makes it back by the crack of dawn, she gets to usher in the day ahead with a glass of breakfast wine.\\nThe people of Mondstadt live in the golden sunlight, but Rosaria dwells under the silver moonlight.\\nIt is a cold, piercing light... just like that of the ice she forms with her Cryo abilities.\\n\"There are some things that young people need not know,\" Rosaria thinks.\\nThough, in her eyes, \"young people\" means all citizens of Mondstadt who live in the light of the sun, regardless of their age.",
            "Character Story 3\tLike a puff of smoke, the lackadaisical Rosaria is impossible to pin down.\\nNevertheless, once she takes on a job, she can be relied on to handle it with the utmost professionalism.\\n\"Lazy\" is the last word that anyone would use to describe her ruthless interrogations of suspicious individuals.\\nShe also possesses exceptional strength and knows the weaknesses of the human body like the back of her hand — and has no reservations about using this knowledge to kill.\\nPeople know her as the lazy, chain-smoking sister, but behind the scenes, she is a formidable purveyor of justice.\\nA strange fate for one who ostensibly basks in the light of the gods.\\nWhat led her to become a blood-soaked slayer? Why does she stay silent while others praise the gods for their protection?\\nPerhaps it should come as no surprise that Rosaria was not born and bred in Mondstadt.\\n\"A city that is fortunate enough to be boring always needs someone to do the dirty work...\"\\nRosaria stubs her cigarette out as she speaks in her characteristically languid manner.\\n\"And as far as I'm concerned, the things I deal with are far simpler than living the life of a traditional sister.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tRosaria may not be one to attend prayer meetings, but that does not mean she doesn't have her own theological viewpoints.\\nIn her view, freedom is the spiritual pillar of Mondstadt's people, and it is the very thing that caused her to end up here in the first place.\\nRosaria was born in a remote mountain village, but was taken from her home shortly after birth by the very same bandits who drenched it in blood.\\nRaised by those crooks, she learned how to fight, sometimes thieving, other times doing odd jobs for the crew.\\nShe was their servant, but also their tool, a crook, yet still a child.\\nShe fought against outsiders and her comrades alike, and growing up was a constant battle for survival against the hunger and cold.\\nRosaria's youth was just like Mondstadt's sunset — blood-red from horizon to horizon, and so fleeting that night had fallen before she'd had the chance to stop and take in the view.\\nUltimately, the bandit crew was wiped out by the Knights of Favonius. As their youngest member, Rosaria was judged to have a chance of rehabilitation.\\nGrand Master Varka brought her to Mondstadt. Sincerely hoping that she might someday fit in here, he advised her:\\n\"Go to the Cathedral and be cleansed by the light of our archon. You still have the chance to turn your fate around and live a normal life.\"\\nBut Varka had not counted on Rosaria constantly skipping classes and dodging hymnal.\\nShe would rather hunt in the wild than settle into a life of dutiful service as a sister. As far as she was concerned, the golden sunlight was not so much cleansing as blinding.\\nFor Rosaria had long since come to understand that she was a child of the moonlight, and it was inevitable that she would someday return to the embrace of darkness.",
            "Character Story 5\tRosaria, the Church's number one truant, became infamous for her absence very early on.\\n\"Miss Rosaria, please, show a little more circumspection in your actions!

Miss Rosaria, I'm told that you have never attended a single one of your compulsory classes. Is that so?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Mother Maria, please look at this... Rosaria's theological essay is an utter mess!\"\\n\"Miss Rosaria, if I may ask frankly... do you intend to do any work at all here at the Church?\"\\n\"No. I've already found other work.\"\\nRosaria never showed so much as a hint of anxiety in any of these exchanges. What's more, it was true — she had indeed found other work for herself, and much darker work at that.\\nThe unexpected twist was that she would ultimately end up doing this work under the aegis of the Church.\\nRosaria the novice did not leave the clergy, but instead became Sister Rosaria without much incident.\\nNevertheless, when she's not on a mission, she does everything she can to avoid attending church activities, instead heading to the taverns to drink or scaling the city walls to view the scenery.\\nAnd when she simply cannot escape a church engagement, you can be sure that she will be the first to leave.\\nThe instant the workday is done, Rosaria vanishes.\\nWhether by bright day or dark night, there is one principle that she will never transgress: no overtime.",
            "Church-Issue Journal\tA journal with a white cover.

Use it to light up your bathroom! Come on, Sir, have a look!\"\\nThere is something incongruous about a random assortment of marketplace cries and advertising slogans having been penned by such a graceful and elegant hand.\\nThis journal is a relic from Rosaria's novice days.\\nClearly, she must have skipped class and headed to the rooftops on the merchant street, bathing in the sun, listening to the eclectic cries of the street vendors, and committing them to paper.",
            "Vision\tRosaria's Vision came to her on a particularly frigid night.\\nThings were getting desperate for the bandit gang — people were starving and the food supplies were dwindling.\\nNever able to eat her fill, Rosaria was driven by hunger to flee into the freezing wind rather than continue another second with the hard labor she was forced to endure.\\nOne of the elders of the gang pursued her and brought her back.\\nHe was the very person who had taken her from the village of her birth, and the one who had taught her how to kill.\\n\"Fleeing makes you a traitor, and traitors can only earn their freedom through victory in combat.\"\\nThe old bandit tossed Rosaria an old dagger.\\n\"Well, come on then! Kill me, and you can leave this place. I'm long in the tooth now, while you've got youth on your side. You can do this, can't ya?\"\\nNo one thought that she would be able to kill him — and yet, the old lion would indeed fall by the newborn cub's claws.\\nThus did the bandits lose an old member and welcome a new one that very night.\\nThe bandits were reluctant to accept Rosaria at first since she had slain one of their own, but they quickly had a change of heart after seeing the Vision in her hand.\\nSurely, a Vision wielder had to be far stronger than some old coot who was about to kick the bucket right? And she ate less, to boot... They could save some food this way.\\nMeanwhile, a question crept into Rosaria's frozen heart:\\nDid he let me replace him on purpose? ...Could a false father have harbored genuine affection for a child he stole so arbitrarily?"

            "Character Details\tMost Inazumans are unaware of the existence of the Shuumatsuban. In fact, the Shuumatsuban is a secret organization under the Yashiro Commission.\\nThere is also a little ninja who goes by the name of Sayu in the Shuumatsuban, and this fact is even less known.\\nSayu is a special existence in the Shuumatsuban. She has been raised in the Shuumatsuban since she was a child, and is extremely loyal to the organization.\\nThat said, her most prominent trait is not \"loyalty\", but \"laziness.\"\\nLazing around is what Sayu does best. She has long mastered the various arts of ninjutsu, particularly those that help her to slack off or shirk her duties, such as escape techniques and aura concealment.\\nPeople who don't know about her habits will have to make a lot of effort to find her.\\nHowever, if you ask Sayu about her slacking, she will shrug and reply, \"It's not that I'm lazy, I just want to spend my time on more meaningful things.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tSayu is petite and can even be described as delicate.\\nThis is also something that bothers her —\\nOne by one, her peers are growing taller, but she still has the stature of a child, as her height has not changed at all.\\nSayu is really anxious about this matter.\\nDay by day, the world seems to be sprouting skyward, and only she remains small as ever.\\nGrowing taller has gradually become an obsession in Sayu's mind.\\n\"As long as I sleep long enough, I can definitely grow taller!\"\\nShe came to believe this ever so firmly, seizing every opportunity to sleep as much as possible, creating every opportunity and circumstance, even when there were none.\\nPeople around little Sayu often let her be, as they don't have the heart to disturb her sleep.\\nSo now, the situation has progressed such that Sayu is able to fall asleep, even whilst standing.",
            "Character Story 2\tThe ninjutsu that Sayu has learned is not very powerful in combat, but it is quite useful in the matter of slacking off.\\nShe is extremely skilled at hiding and covering her tracks, and is an expert in this area. Therefore, if she has the intention to hide, ordinary people absolutely cannot find her.\\nHowever, even the most ingenious puzzles have answers, and even the most elusive treasures have clues for people to find them. This also holds true for Sayu.\\nAfter spending enough time with Sayu, one will understand her habits and preferences. Trying to find her doesn't seem so difficult anymore.\\nFor example, if you go to Sayu's room early in the morning and lift the covers, the odds are that you will find her in bed.\\nAt noon, you can check out the trees near the shrine and who knows, you may find something unexpected.\\nIt will be more challenging to find Sayu at night, but it's a good idea to go to her house and wait for her to emerge.\\nHowever, please remember not to disturb Sayu, who is busy growing taller, unless it is absolutely necessary.\\nEven gentle rabbits bite when provoked, let alone Sayu...",
            "Character Story 3\tThat said, finding Sayu doesn't mean that she can be put to work quietly.\\nMoreover, Sayu's work at the Shuumatsuban is not that of a fixed daily routine, but missions that pop up if and as needed.\\nAnd so, this happens:\\nWhen new missions are assigned, you won't see hide or tail of her.\\nBy the time she has been found (and with much effort), a more suitable person has been assigned for the mission.\\nAnd in case there is no other suitable candidate other than Sayu, all the more she will try to slip away, so as not to be overwhelmed by the mission.\\nIt's just that... If Sayu used her ninjutsu to work hard, she would have had great accomplishments in the Shuumatsuban.",
            "Character Story 4\tSayu is the last successor to the Ninjutsu Art — Yoohoo Art.\\nIn this school of ninjutsu, which is known for teasing its enemies, Sayu has learned only ninjutsu such as escape and clone techniques.\\nThese ninjutsu are of little use in actual combat, but have an undeniable aesthetic flair.\\nAmongst falling leaves, a silhouette vanishes in a flash, a gentle breeze blows, and a kite suddenly appears on the ground... The incredible scene is comparable to an artistic performance.\\nThus, whenever there is a festival, Sayu will be invited by various parties to perform her mysterious ninjutsu.\\nIf it's Yoimiya who's searching for her, Sayu can still find ways to hide.\\nBut if the person in question is Lady Guuji Yae, resistance is futile for Sayu.\\nClone techniques do nothing to fool the Lady Guuji's sharp eyes, and aura concealment doesn't help Sayu at all in escaping from the Lady Guuji's grasp.\\nRunning for the hills is even less feasible, and might even risk angering the Lady Guuji...\\nFortunately, there are very few circumstances that require Lady Guuji Yae to make a personal appearance.",
            "Character Story 5\tFor as long as Sayu can remember, she has been studying ninjutsu with her sensei in the Shuumatsuban.\\nAlthough the Shuumatsuban is a clandestine organization, the elders are very kind and have taken good care of young Sayu.\\n\"Being overly reliant on others is never a good thing for a ninja.\"\\nAfter Sayu had reached a bottleneck in learning ninjutsu, her sensei observed her situation and thought thusly.\\nAs the years passed, Sayu grew steadily. Once she was capable enough to defend herself, her sensei chose to leave quietly.\\nA young animal that leaves the protection of its parents will grow up rapidly. The same is true of the sensei's expectations for Sayu.\\nThe young ninja did not disappoint her sensei. Soon after, Sayu obtained a Vision.\\nAnd then, she started working diligently in the Shuumatsuban... diligently shirking her duties.\\nSayu is always busy sleeping and hiding from people, so in that sense, she also has a lot to do.\\nOccasionally, when Sayu is free and alone to enjoy the moonlight, she feels lost deep inside.\\nThe people who have always been with you will one day leave...is this how life is meant to be?\\nBut perhaps someday in the future, I will also meet the person who will always be with me.\\nPondering the matter, the little ninja fell asleep again...",
            "Mini Mujina\tSayu's outfit is said to be a gift from her sensei.\\nThe style references the form of a small animal — the \"mujina,\" and Sayu's favorite colors were also specially chosen for it.\\nIt is light and flexible, thus making it suitable for a ninja.\\nSayu is especially fond of the huge hood, as it brings about a sense of security.\\nThe long tail is designed for Sayu to maintain balance on the branches.\\nAs for the only drawback... this outfit probably looks too much like a tanuki, and Sayu often gets misunderstood because of it.\\nInitially, she would seriously explain to the other party that:\\n\"I'm not a tanuki, I'm Sayu.\"\\nHowever, over time, similar incidents have occurred too many times, and Sayu now bears a grudge against tanuki.\\nNowadays, if such a situation happens again, Sayu will pout in anger.\\nSo, in order to get along well with Sayu, please memorize the following:\\nSayu is not a tanuki, but Sayu.\\nHer outfit is also not that of a tanuki's, but a mini mujina.",
            "Vision\tThis is the story of Sayu when she just started being on her own.\\nFragile beings walking alone in this world inevitably find themselves in scary situations. The only way to understand what it's like is to have experienced it.\\nThis is exactly what happened to Sayu. Adept at observation and evasion, she has always understood that she is not suitable for combat.\\nHer overly petite stature gives her no advantage in terms of strength to speak of, and her ninjutsu will not be of much use in actual combat.\\nYet missions do not wait for ninjas to grow fully before descending upon them. In an era of turmoil, Sayu would also find herself in trouble because of not-so-important work.\\nSurrounded by strong foes, she had to do her best and barely managed to escape. It cost her almost everything to bring the information back safely.\\nExhausted and wounded, Sayu was about to faint, but only one thing lingered in her mind:\\n\"It's not only strong brute force that can overpower everything, the weak have their own way of surviving. It's because you're weak that you can notice those unseen moments that change your fate... The chances of escaping from here are slim, but that's what my ninjutsu is for.\"\\nThe moment the leaves fell, she disappeared. All her pursuers were incredulous. The tiny ninja disappeared as if she were dust in the wind.\\nThe next morning, Sayu struggled to get up, and found that the ninja pack strapped to her leg had long since disappeared.\\nHowever, a surprising object appeared in the same place instead — a Vision gleaming in the sunrise.\\nNow, with the power of the Vision, Sayu can wield a claymore taller than herself. She no longer has to fear the omnipresent strife of a chaotic world.\\nUnfortunately, Sayu's most immediate worries have not yet been resolved.\\nRegarding her growing taller, it seems that even a Vision is unable to do anything about it."

        "story": [
            "Character Details\tSucrose may be the assistant of the genius alchemist Albedo, but they could not be more different in research direction.\\nAs opposed to studying the essence of alchemy and the ability to create new life, she is far more interested in using alchemy to modify existing life, all the better to add variety and color to this world.\\nDespite her youth, she has already achieved some brilliant results. For example, she has been able to increase the nectar output of Sweet Flowers by 70% by irrigating them with a special potion. She has also developed a special spray that allows Sunsettias to maintain their freshness for a whole month after being plucked from the branch.\\nEven people who were initially suspicious of her research inclinations have come to acknowledge her exceptional talents in the field of alchemy after seeing such results.\\nHowever, she merely considers these to be incidental steps on the path to a successful experiment, rather than the success itself. Her true aim is much more ambitious than this.\\nIt's a secret, and is also her little dream.",
            "Character Story 1\tBio-alchemy explores numerous lines of inquiry, all of which stem from Sucrose's questions about living things in the world. These questions, in turn, are born out of her insatiable curiosity, a faculty that is far more developed in her than it is in most.\\nFor instance, Sucrose's curiosity was once drawn to the sweet flower, accepted by most people as simply being a source of sugar.\\nShe wondered: Although sweetness is clearly the most readily identifiable feature of this plant, should that be grounds for limiting its application as we have tended to do? Does it not merit further study?\\nSo, after a careful study of the various features of sweet flowers, she devised thirty-something distinct rearing plans along with numerous control groups to account for temperature and other environmental conditions.\\nAnd yet, her experiment still underestimated just how many variations were possible. After the experiment began, Sucrose found herself with more questions rather than fewer, and the novel discoveries that her experiment yielded gave her inspiration for further research.\\nSucrose is incapable of leaving a question unattended to — it makes her restless, even guilty, to ignore it. Spurred on by this quirk of her temperament, her rearing plans grew in number to almost three hundred.\\nThe result was a whole new series of sweet flower strains: Some with thrice the number of flowers, some with heads five or six times the normal size that could even float in the wind, and some even producing a sweet-tasting fruit.\\nMonths of experimentation later, Sucrose had finally answered every last one of her questions pertaining to sweet flowers. As she finished writing up her research notes, she let out a long sigh of relief.\\nThough she was physically and mentally exhausted, the sight of stack after stack of her bio-alchemical research volumes stretching around three walls of the room gave her a deep sense of joy and satisfaction.",
            "Character Story 2\tTo the people around her, Sucrose comes across as a quiet, introverted alchemist with little interest in the lives of others.\\nIn fact, the truth is quite the opposite: Sucrose is fascinated by absolutely everything that exists in the world. The only thing is, she finds the discipline of social interaction to be far more difficult to master than that of alchemy.\\nIn alchemy, the process of trial-and-error coupled with a determination to get to the truth is sufficient to bring you to your answer eventually. But with interpersonal relationships, there is the added complication of having to factor in manners, moods, and other unquantifiable variables. To make things worse, there seems to be no room for an approach that relies heavily on making errors.\\nHence, Sucrose decided to avoid such variables at all costs and stick to her familiar methods in satisfying her curiosity.\\nFor instance, Sucrose had always been curious about whether she and Cat's Tail bartender Diona, both of whom have animal ears, had any shared ancestry.\\nIn fact, this was not a private matter, and most people would simply ask the question. But Sucrose was concerned that it would be a sensitive topic — she, for one, did not like people drawing attention to her ears.\\nSo, she resorted to the method she knew best: observation.\\nFor one whole month, Diona constantly had an unnerving sense that someone was secretly watching her. She assumed that one of the tavern patrons was stalking her, and was none too happy about it.\\n\"Similar genome, but ultimately different ancestry. Cat connection merits further study. Note: Unable to obtain bone sample thus far.\"\\nThis is the conclusion that Sucrose has jotted down in her notebook based on her findings so far.\\nBio-alchemy aside, Sucrose made one further discovery from this episode.\\nThat is to say, judging by the pair of cat-ear spectacles she made for herself after the event, it would appear that she has finally come to comprehend a certain uniquely feline variety of cuteness. She is too shy to wear them in public, however, and only puts them on when alone in her room.",
            "Character Story 3\tOnce every three days, Sucrose ventures out into the real world at dusk. To her, these excursions are rare and momentous events.\\nOne by one, she visits the butcher's, the Adventurers' Guild, and the Springvale hunters, looking for a material of a very specific kind.\\n\"H—Hi... Sorry, I... I'd like, um, the freshest, best-quality b—bones you've got... Yep, the ones with the blood and meat still on.\"\\nPeople found her behavior utterly unusual at first, but once they had gotten used to it, they were eager to oblige, even putting the rarest bones aside for her in advance.\\nThis was a major bonus for her. Not only was she able to acquire an ample supply of the usual chicken and boar bones, but she also got her hands on a complete lizard skeleton and even a chunk of hilichurl leg bone still bearing fresh blood.\\nHer eyes would light up with excitement at the sight of these strange and rare bones. She would thank Katheryne of the Adventurers' Guild profusely, bowing to her over and over.\\nAs well as going some way towards satisfying Sucrose's curiosity, she also found new inspiration from piecing new bones together\\nMore importantly, collecting skeletons was her hobby, and she was crazy about it.\\nOne day, Sucrose happened to overhear a mother attempting to discipline her child:\\n\"If you don't do as your told, the scary old lady with the cloth sack over her back will come to your door, go into your room, pick out every bone from your body, and take them away!\"\\nSucrose's curiosity compelled her to investigate further. It turned out that this was nothing more than a ghost story used by mothers to shock their children into compliance, and that it had existed long before Sucrose was even born.\\nShe breathed a sigh of relief when she found out the truth.\\nSoon after this, people noticed that Sucrose had switched her cloth sack for a leather one. Perhaps she did this just because she was shy. Or perhaps it was to avoid arousing suspicion...",
            "Character Story 4\tAs an assistant, Sucrose does everything she can to support Albedo, and even though his alchemical inquiries tend more towards the abstruse, she finds herself learning a lot every time.\\nAfter an experiment lasting five straight days and nights came to its end, Albedo noticed that Sucrose was on the brink of collapsing from exhaustion, and organized a mandatory seven-day vacation for her.\\nSucrose began her holiday determined to take a proper rest and regain her energy, but from the moment that she woke up on day one she struggled to adjust to the vacation lifestyle.\\nFirst things first, let's get some breakfast: fried eggs, sausages, and a cup of coffee. Nothing new to report there. All of these were foods and beverages that she had previously researched, after all.\\nNext, she thought, how about a little rest and relaxation in the sun with a good book? Again, nothing new to report: plenty of research shows this to be one of the most effective means of relaxation. There wasn't a book that she hadn't already read, and there wasn't a query that she hadn't already highlighted, looked into, and later annotated for clarification.\\nSo then she did some household chores: laundry, dusting, tidying. Check. Once again — nothing new to report. There was nothing to dispute about the fact that a clean and tidy environment is conducive to mental well-being.\\nHalf a day in, and Sucrose had not had the occasion to ask \"why\" or \"how\" even once.\\nShe was bored, restless, and angsty, and she could not calm herself down.\\nShe was desperate to throw herself at a research problem. It didn't matter what it was: She would have happily researched the potted plants on the terrace, even if nothing came of it. Anything just to pass the time.\\nBut wherever she looked — the Lamp Grass to her left, the Sweet Flower in front of her, or the Cecilia to her right — all she found were things that she had previously researched in exhaustive detail.\\nFinally, she gave up and forced herself to go to sleep. The next day, she reported to the laboratory first thing in the morning.\\n\"All day long, you have nothing to research, and nothing to question. That's not rest, it's torture!\"",
            "Character Story 5\tSucrose's childhood was no different from anyone else's in Mondstadt. She had loving parents, she had her best friends. Life was simple, and beautiful.\\nHer most enduring childhood memory is a story she once heard about a wonderful paradise.\\nSomewhere in a far-flung corner of Teyvat, there was an undiscovered domain with pretty pink flowers the height of a hundred people, teeny-tiny floating fairies flying over all the place, and beautiful unicorns, the pinnacle of perfection.\\nSucrose and her two best friends believed that if only they could reach this magical place, they would surely live happily ever after.\\nBut time went by, and one of her friends left on a long journey with her adventurer parents, never to return.\\nThe other suffered a domestic tragedy: Her father fell ill and passed away, her whole personality changed, and she broke off her friendship with Sucrose. The promise that they had once made to reunite some day in the future no longer meant anything.\\nSucrose felt lonelier then than she ever had felt before in her whole life. They hadn't even set eyes on paradise yet, and already her friends were gone...\\nWell. Even if they were destined to never meet again, Sucrose was desperate to honor their past friendship in some way. That was when she discovered the existence of alchemy from a book that she was reading.\\nSucrose realized: Though she had never had the chance to find the entrance to that wondrous place, she now had the opportunity to be the creator of her own paradise.\\nThus began her study of bio-alchemy, and she poured all of her curiosity and passion into it.\\nStill, she has never once mentioned the story of paradise and her bygone friendships to anyone else.\\nPerhaps one day, when that place she first learned of in a children's storybook finally becomes a reality in the real world, her friends will return.",
            "Mist Flower Project 3, Version 17, Enlargement Trial\tSucrose has a set of strict requirements when it comes to the selection of species for her personal paradise. After experimentation, specimens that are up to standard she tags with \"pass.\"\\nAt first, she wanted to give exotic-sounding names to each of her plants, just like in the stories, but whenever she came to try and name something, she found herself completely at a loss for ideas.\\nAfter spending so long as a scientist, she insisted on flawless logic even when it came to relatively trivial matters such as naming.\\nHer earliest batch of names included the following: \"Grassflower,\" a flower that grows on grass;\\n\"Flowergrass,\" a grass that grows beneath flowers;\\n\"Multigrassflower,\" a flower that grows on dense grass, and so on and so forth.\\nEven such un-paradisiacal names as these would take Sucrose forever to come up with — far longer than the duration of the experiments themselves.\\nIn the end, she gave up on naming altogether and simply used the specimen identifiers from her research notes instead. Yes, this meant the names ended up being much longer, but, but...\\n...But anyway, Sucrose is the creator of this paradise, so why shouldn't she get to name things any way she wants to?",
            "Vision\tIt was on an afternoon just like any other that Sucrose received her Vision.\\nReady to begin her one-hundred-and-fifty-ninth dandelion-seed simmering experiment, she poured her carefully crafted alchemical solution into the cauldron.\\nInstantly, the cauldron hit boiling point, and the entire room was filled with steam. Sucrose rushed to the cauldron, anxious to see what new transmutation had occurred this time; in her excitement, she even burned both of her hands on the lip of the cauldron.\\nMuch to her disappointment, however, the Dandelion Seeds had once again burned to a crisp. But there was something new there, too: lying there amidst the black Dandelion Seeds was a Vision.\\nAnd yet, rather than pouring out the liquid and taking her Vision, she first thought for a moment and then lit the fire up again to continue simmering the contents of the cauldron.\\nShe was curious to know what further reactions might occur between Dandelion Seeds and Visions.\\nSadly, the experiment ended in failure after three hours of constant simmering.\\nStill, there was no denying that she had reaped a great reward from this experiment, for the elemental energy provided by her Vision would become her single greatest asset in her future bio-alchemical endeavors."

            "Character Details\tDespite holding one of the most senior positions in the Fatui as one of the Eleven Harbingers, Childe very much looks like the young adult that he still is.\\nHe is a wolf in sheep's clothing, however, for under the cheerful and confident appearance lies a deadly swordsman.\\nHe is the youngest among the Harbingers, but one of the most dangerous among their number.\\nThat said, Childe doesn't seem to fit in well with the others.\\nAs a fighter first and foremost, he is quite at odds with this organization of deceit and treachery.",
            "Character Story 1\tAs the youngest Harbinger in the history of the Fatui, Childe is hardly bound by convention, and plays by his own rules accordingly.\\nThough this lone wolf is not so well-received by his peers and is also at odds with their methods, his cavalier demeanor hides a responsible, watertight meticulousness.\\nHe is a proud man of his word. Even if the promise he makes is absurd, he will never break it.\\nBe it exterminating all the dragons inside their lairs, venturing into a domain of extreme danger, or single-handedly overthrowing the territory of a nobleman...\\nHe not only keeps his promises, but does so with finesse and surgical precision. As the Harbingers' vanguard, Childe always appears in the vulnerable underbellies of Snezhnaya's enemy states, striking as a conflict is about to erupt.",
            "Character Story 2\tMany myths in Snezhnaya say that Tartaglia has been on the battlefield since he was 14 years old.\\nOddly enough, at that young age he already seemed to be a skilled slaughterer with mastery of many forms of martial arts.\\nBut more terrifying than his skill in combat was his passion for it.\\nPerilous battles would only excite him, and terrifying foes would exhilarate him all the more.\\nChilde's arrogance and conceit are derived from honing himself across countless battles, and from unmatched combat experience.\\nOn the other hand, because they fret about the way his quarrelsome personality tends to invite unwanted trouble, the other Harbingers constantly try to get him sent on missions to places as far from Snezhnaya as possible, so that they can avoid the fallout.\\nThe man is incomprehensibly ever in the eye of the storm, and these unusual experiences have also made him quite the show-off who revels in the praise of others.\\nUnlike other members of the Harbingers, who prefer to keep a low profile, Tartaglia will often go to watch public performances — occasionally even becoming part of the show himself.",
            "Character Story 3\tIce fishing has been one of Tartaglia's hobbies since childhood.\\nIn those days, he was known neither by the names Tartaglia nor \"Childe,\" as the Fatui call him, but as Ajax, named by his father after some hero's tale. He and his father would cut holes open upon frozen lakes before sitting beside them and tending to their fishing lines.\\nThis was no easy task, and would sometimes take the entire morning.\\nBut whether it was chiseling away at the thick ice or the long waits in between catches, he was always accompanied by his father's unending tales of adventure.\\nThese were stories of his father's adventures from when he was young, and they became the future that Tartaglia secretly envisioned for himself.\\nSo he would pay close attention, putting himself into the shoes of the protagonist of those tales, immersing himself fully in them even as they waited for a fish to bite.\\nEven after leaving home, Ajax, later to be known as \"Childe\" Tartaglia, would keep up that hobby of his.\\nNo longer accompanied by the stories of bygone days, fishing instead became an opportunity to train — to hone his endurance, and reflect on combat techniques.\\nSuch long periods of meditation to refine his skills swiftly relegated the question of a successful catch to irrelevance.",
            "Character Story 4\tUnlike what the rest of the world may think, Tartaglia was not born with his exceptional skills in battle.\\nBut he would never speak to anyone about that critical, fateful encounter of his...\\nWhen he was 14, he fled his monotonous life at home with nothing but a shortsword and a bag of bread in hand.\\nThat 14-year-old boy got lost in the snowy forest.\\nPursued by bears and wolf packs, he lost his footing and fell into a bottomless crack in the earth's surface.\\nThere, he witnessed the endless possibilities of another ancient world. There, he would meet a mysterious swordswoman...\\nOr perhaps one should say that this dark realm had sensed the burning ambition in this boy's heart.\\nThis darkness was something that the Harbinger Childe could never again delve into.\\nIn those three months, the swordswoman taught Tartaglia how to pass through the Abyss unhindered, and more importantly, nurtured the ability to stir up endless havoc from within Ajax's trouble-mongering nature.\\nNo one knew what happened within that darkness during those three months, nor would Ajax ever speak of this to anyone.\\nWhen his worried mother and sisters finally found him in that forest, only 3 days had passed in this world.\\nThus did Ajax's first adventure end, with his now-rusty shortsword in hand.\\nThis would mark the end of his youth and the beginning of his days as a warrior.",
            "Character Story 5\tBy the time he returned home, the young man was no longer the same.\\nHe was no longer frightened and hesitant but had become frivolous and confident. He acted as if this world revolved around him, and as if battle existed for his sake.\\nConflict often brings about change, and this capricious, incalculable change attracted Ajax like a revolving kaleidoscope.\\nIn the eyes of his father, that third son that he had so worried about had changed for the worse, bringing much uncalled-for havoc to the seaside village of Morepesok.\\nOr perhaps it would be more accurate to say that Ajax had become a nexus of strife, for no matter where he went, fights and squabbles would follow — and he reveled in it.\\nUltimately, after a huge brawl was pacified with some difficulty and with some near-fatal misses, his father had no choice but to hand his beloved son over for conscription into the Fatui.\\nHe hoped that the strict military training of the Fatui could hone his son's temper, but wound up watching fully-armed troops getting the stuffing beaten out of them by a mere child.\\nThis was a great disappointment to his father, but it also caught the attention of Pulcinella, the 5th Harbinger.\\nShocked by Ajax's great strength and curious about how he invariably became the eye of a vortex of discord, Pulcinella inducted Ajax into the Fatui under the pretext of meting out punishment, ordering him to start from the bottom and take up the duty of serving the Tsaritsa.\\nHis insatiable desire for conquest would thus be constantly satiated in fighting for the Fatui, and his ever-burgeoning ego would gorge upon the elation of vanquishing mighty foes...\\nUntil at last, Ajax was chosen to be one of the Fatui Harbingers, donning the mantle of \"Childe\" Tartaglia and becoming one of the most powerful people in Snezhnaya.\\nBut becoming Tartaglia was far from his end goal. To someone who sought to conquer the world, this was but a tiny step in his journey.",

Has the old man's headache gotten any better?\\nPlease send my regards to our parents and our siblings.\\nI've sent some wind chill medication over from Liyue Harbor. It's very effective, and will probably keep him from nagging for a while. It should reach you after a few days.\\nApart from our father's affairs, I naturally haven't forgotten about gifts for you all.\\nThis letter should come with two kites from Liyue, a rattle drum, two porcelain dolls from Inazuma, and a crate full of various snacks.\\nAnd please break it to Anthon that the residents of Liyue are just boring old ordinary humans, like us.\\nThey're not made of stone, and they don't even eat stones.\\nDo not fret for my sake, Tonia, and refrain from making trouble for anyone at home. I will be home soon. When I have seized the seven stars of Liyue and laid them at the feet of Her Majesty the Tsaritsa, I will take the first ship home, just as I promised — and you know how I always keep my promises.\\nYours faithfully, Your loyal knight.\"",
            "Delusion\tTartaglia's Delusion is his old badge of honor and the proof of his strength.\\nHe still remembers with perfect clarity the day when he received his Delusion and ascended to become a member of the Harbingers.\\nAs he stood before the cold, stern Tsaritsa, The Jester, the very first of the Fatui, personally pinned this insignia onto him.\\nIt was his reward for slaying many terrible beasts, and a memento of countless battles.\\nBut it was not this that brought Tartaglia joy, for honor is the natural reward of the warrior.\\nNor did he pay any mind to the odd looks his new \"colleagues\" gave him, for the opinions and bellyaches of others meant nothing to him.\\nThe sight of the Tsaritsa on her lofty throne alone stirred the young man's heart with respect and admiration, not merely because she opened the way for him to find an abundance of looming battles, but also because of the way she looked upon him.\\nHer gaze was cold but pure, arrogant yet sharp.\\nShe was not only the sacrosanct Cryo Archon but also a true warrior.\\nThus did Childe, having received his Delusion, swear an oath of fealty to the one and only Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya."

The winds blow through Mondstadt all year, so this supply of water is very stable.\\nPaimon: Also, the windmills are what they call \"visible winds\" — and wind chimes are called the \"audible winds.\"\\nPaimon: Paimon guesses they can be thought of as mascots and prayers to the Anemo Archon for protection.\\n{NICKNAME}: Ah, mascots. So, like you then, Paimon?\\nPaimon: No! Not at all!

It's all very sophisticated.\\nPaimon: Over the years, many heroes and swordsmen have also chosen Dihua Marsh as the location of their duels.\\nPaimon: The more reeds, the more elegant the place. But in places where the reeds are the thickest, the water can be quite deep...\\nPaimon: So there are a lot of unlucky duelists who fall in and drown while the duel is on...\\n{NICKNAME}: And what's my takeaway from all of this supposed to be?\\nPaimon: Don't get into a fight in Dihua Marsh!",

Paimon's not quite sure...\\n{NICKNAME}: Well then, let me tell you the story of the lucky crane repaying its debts.\\n{NICKNAME}: A long, long time ago, there was a kind-hearted scholar who saved a lucky crane that had fallen into a trap.\\n{NICKNAME}: Later, on a cold winter's night, a beautiful maiden came to his door, asking to lodge with him.\\n{NICKNAME}: The maiden shouldered a greatsword on her back, and taught all that she knew of swordsmanship to the scholar, supervising him as he studied day and night.\\nPaimon: Whoa...\\n{NICKNAME}: Once he had finished his training, he went out into the wilds with the maiden to do good and fight for justice.\\n{NICKNAME}: Ten years later, the lucky crane took the form of a gentleman, and finally came to return the favor, but discovered the couple had already lived out a fortuitous life...\\n{NICKNAME}: And that is the story known as \"The Gentleman's 10-Year Debt.\"\\nPaimon: Ahh...",
            "About Jueyun Karst\t{NICKNAME}: Rumor has it that Jueyun Karst is the abode of the adepti.\\nPaimon: Wow — the abode of the adepti!\\n{NICKNAME}: Perhaps we'll meet the adepti on those cloud-piercing mountain peaks.\\nPaimon: Wow — meeting adepti!\\n{NICKNAME}: But I wonder, how would one normally communicate with the adepti?\\nPaimon: Wow — communicating with adepti!\\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm. My emergency rations seem to be going bad. Best to consume them quickly...\\nPaimon: Ahem. Well... Paimon thinks that shouting from the mountaintop should work.\\n{NICKNAME}: That seems more like a way of getting the attention of a hilichurl, rather than an adeptus.",

Does Rex Lapis have any deeper intentions?\\n{NICKNAME}: I have my guesses...\\n{NICKNAME}: You see, those annual divine predictions have already captured the hearts of the people of Liyue too much.\\n{NICKNAME}: Round and around they analyze and scrutinize every single word, finding limitless \"hidden meanings\" within them...\\n{NICKNAME}: What do you think would happen to Liyue if such predictions were available every day?\\nPaimon: Ah!\\nPaimon: Paimon gets it now. Paimon would be offering Rex Lapis' favorite snacks to him every day!\\nPaimon: If you could just get Mora straight from Morax's hands, who would ever need to do a day of honest work?\\n{NICKNAME}: Heh... you made... some logical leaps, but that's basically how it is.",
            "About Benny's Adventure Team\tPaimon: If you want to adventure together with Benny's Adventure Team, you have to come prepared.\\nPaimon: Domains are very dangerous, so you should always take care to double- and triple-check your supplies in advance.\\nPaimon: Paimon's heard that the Adventurers' Guild has compiled a list of 463 different ways of dying in these domains...\\nPaimon: If Bennett got you killed by accident, Paimon and Bennett would never forgive ourselves!\\n{NICKNAME}: ...Why am I the only one dying here?\\nPaimon: Well, that's because according to the numbers, Paimon can avoid 322 causes of death just by floating!\\n{NICKNAME}: I suddenly don't feel like exploring these domains...",
            "About Bennett\t{NICKNAME}: I've heard that Albert, being the leader of Barbara's fan club...\\n{NICKNAME}: ...Sometimes gets bumps and bruises on purpose so he can go to the Cathedral to see her.\\nPaimon: Paimon feels the Knights of Favonius should keep a closer watch on weirdos like that.\\n{NICKNAME}: But it seems that a month later, Albert discovered that Bennett was managing to see Barbara far more than he was.\\n{NICKNAME}: Well... Bennett does have the natural advantage when it comes to getting injured, after all.\\nPaimon: What is this, a \"let's bother Barbara\" contest?",
            "About the \"Idol\"\tPaimon: Barbara's really popular, isn't she?\\n{NICKNAME}: Well, she is the idol of the people of Mondstadt.\\nPaimon: Come to think of it... Paimon doesn't really know what an \"idol\" is.\\n{NICKNAME}: It's an occupation in which one's work is to be cute, be well-loved, and earn a boat-load of Mora.\\nPaimon: Isn't that the same thing as being a mascot?\\n{NICKNAME}: That's... heh, one way to put it.",
            "About Being Sisters\t{NICKNAME}: Lisa and Amber feel a bit like sisters.\\nPaimon: Huh? Why's that?\\n{NICKNAME}: Amber often runs errands for Lisa. Older siblings asking their younger siblings to do things for them so that they can slack off is a rather common practice...\\n{NICKNAME}: But my sister and I are the same age, so we had to decide these things via rock-paper-scissors.\\nPaimon: Whoa. So, doesn't that make you my younger brother?\\n{NICKNAME}: What do you mean?\\nPaimon: Well, since Paimon floats, you're the only one who can \"run\" any errands!\\n{NICKNAME}: ...Seriously?",

Maybe he'll even get a weird nickname!\\nPaimon: Like, say, \"Pasty Eye\"!\\n{NICKNAME}: Guess he didn't need to take it off to get a weird nickname...",
            "About Kaeya and Diluc\tPaimon: Strange...\\n{NICKNAME}: What's wrong?\\nPaimon: Diluc and Kaeya are really alike, so why don't they get along?\\n{NICKNAME}: How are they alike, again?\\nPaimon: Well, Kaeya's the kind of guy who acts shady in the light of day...\\nPaimon: While Diluc is a shining beacon of justice in the dark of night!\\nPaimon: Don't you think that's kinda the same thing...?\\n{NICKNAME}: Uhh... I still don't see it.",
            "About Measuring Fighting Strength\t{NICKNAME}: If one hilichurl could beat, say, three wild boars...\\n{NICKNAME}: Then how many hilichurls would it take to reach the fighting prowess of Master Jean and Master Diluc?\\nPaimon: Not sure... but if you heard the way everyone talks in Mondstadt, you'd know that Master Jean is the strongest.\\n{NICKNAME}: Uhh... I'd say that if Diluc strikes first, Master Jean wouldn't be able to counter.\\nPaimon: Oh, she'd find a way.\\n{NICKNAME}: There's no way.\\nPaimon: Master Jean's Elemental Burst is really strong, you know~\\n{NICKNAME}: Yes, but that \"field\" would also make Diluc stronger.\\nPaimon: Paimon doesn't think Master Jean would even need her Vision to take on Master Diluc, because—\\n{NICKNAME}: Diluc would only need a beginner's greatsword to—\\nPaimon: Argh...\\n{NICKNAME}: Ugh...\\n{NICKNAME}: *sigh* ...This is so dumb.\\n{NICKNAME}: They both fight for Mondstadt, so they wouldn't come to blows.\\nPaimon: That's why Paimon likes your idea of measuring their fighting strength in number of hilichurls.\\nPaimon: ...Or in Paimon's case, in fifths of a wild boar.",
            "About Razor\tPaimon: {NICKNAME}, you know what a brush is, right?\\n{NICKNAME}: Of course! Kinda like pens but with animal hair at one end for calligraphy, right?\\nPaimon: That's correct! They say that finely-made brushes sell for high prices among Liyue's merchants!\\n{NICKNAME}: So, would you like to make some too?\\nPaimon: Uh-huh! But wild wolves are too fierce, so we should use Razor's fur to make brushes instead!\\nPaimon: Razor's fur is all downy and soft. It'll definitely make great wolf-fur brushes! We could make lots of Mora like this!\\n{NICKNAME}: Brushes made like that would conduct electricity. I'm not sure we could use them.\\n{NICKNAME}: Besides, Razor isn't a wolf, nor are wolf-fur brushes made from actual wolves' fur...\\nPaimon: Huh? Why are they called wolf-fur brushes, then?\\n{NICKNAME}: Well, does Cider Lake look like it's full of cider to you?\\nPaimon: Hmm. You have a point.",
            "About Klee\tPaimon: Klee's a really interesting kid.\\nPaimon: All the Knights seem to like her a lot, too. You could even say they spoil her.\\n{NICKNAME}: I wonder who makes the better mascot: Paimon or Klee?\\n{NICKNAME}: Oh wait, I forgot. Paimon's not a mascot, Paimon's emergency—\\nPaimon: Hey! Paimon knows exactly what you're going to say. That joke stopped being funny a long time ago.",
            "About the \"Wondermaid\"\tPaimon: It's time for Paimon's Little Life Tips!\\n{NICKNAME}: \"Little Life Tips\"?\\nPaimon: In Mondstadt, if there's something you can't fix, or there's something you can't get clean no matter what you do...\\nPaimon: If you ever run into something you can't handle yourself, you just need to shout this name into the skies:\\nPaimon: \"Noeeeelle!\"\\nPaimon: And everything that's troubling you will be swept away in an instant.\\n{NICKNAME}: So this is one of the tricks to living in Mondstadt... Pretty impressive...",
            "About Fischl\tPaimon: Fischl makes a very unique impression, doesn't she?\\n{NICKNAME}: How so?\\nPaimon: Well, she travels together with a talking raven, for starters.\\n{NICKNAME}: Well, I'm traveling with you. It's not all that different.\\n{NICKNAME}: Still, Oz can also translate for Fischl. You, on the other hand...\\nPaimon: What!? Paimon's way better than some bird!\\n{NICKNAME}: Haha, how so?\\nPaimon: Well, um... uh... at least Paimon doesn't need wings to fly!",
            "About Pets\t{NICKNAME}: Speaking of Fischl, she also claims to be a \"visitor from another world\"...\\n{NICKNAME}: We're similar in that way. We even bring a pet along with us.\\nPaimon: Pet? Now, wait just a minute, here...\\n{NICKNAME}: But her raven, Oz... He looks cool, and is polite to boot.\\n{NICKNAME}: More importantly, he can both scout and fight — very useful indeed.\\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe I should make arrangements with Fischl to trade companions once in a while for, say, a week or two at a time. It should be quite interesting.\\nPaimon: Hey! Doesn't Paimon get a say in this!?",
            "About Beidou\tPaimon: How do you become as popular and cool as Captain Beidou?\\n{NICKNAME}: With enough experience...?\\nPaimon: Paimon's already seen lots of things from adventuring together with you!\\n{NICKNAME}: One also needs to experience trials and setbacks...\\nPaimon: Paimon almost drowned that one time...\\n{NICKNAME}: ...Maintain an inspirational disposition...\\nPaimon: Uh-huh! Paimon's always rooted for you!\\n{NICKNAME}: One must also have a... mature outlook towards problems.\\nPaimon: Hey! Are you just trying to say that Paimon can't make it?",
            "About Ningguang\tPaimon: How does a person become as rich... no, as super rich as Lady Ningguang?\\n{NICKNAME}: Is that the only impression she gives you? Riches?\\nPaimon: Well, there's the huge Jade Chamber, too! But isn't that also made of Mora?\\n{NICKNAME}: Well, you need an excellent mind...\\nPaimon: Well... Paimon's really good at giving people nicknames!\\n{NICKNAME}: You need to be very familiar with the workings of the markets...\\nPaimon: A serving of Fisherman's Toast goes for 1,025 Mora, and no discounts — even on rainy days.\\n{NICKNAME}: You also need to be willing to work really hard...\\nPaimon: Okay then... so, how do you make friends with a really rich person?\\n{NICKNAME}: Wait, you're giving up already!?",

That's a vampire.\\nPaimon: Then, will she transform during a full moon?\\n{NICKNAME}: Werewolves, Paimon. Not zombies.\\nPaimon: Huh... As expected of a traveler, you really know a lot!\\nPaimon: So, what special things can zombies do?\\n{NICKNAME}: Exercises?\\nPaimon: Ah, that makes a lot of sense! So, the ones that do exercises are zombies — got it!",

            "About Slimes\tPaimon: What sort of slime do you like the most, {NICKNAME}?\\n{NICKNAME}: Pyro Slimes, I suppose. You can feel their warmth just by getting close. That's something you'll need in the winter.\\nPaimon: That's very practical, as expected of a traveler.\\n{NICKNAME}: What about you, Paimon?\\nPaimon: Paimon likes them all! They're all very tasty!\\n{NICKNAME}: Tasty? Hmm...\\nPaimon: Turning slimes into bubbly, lovely, jubbly meals is the Paimon Special!\\n{NICKNAME}: Well then...\\n{NICKNAME}: I suppose that's one more thing I can eat before you become emergency rations, huh, Paimon?\\nPaimon: Uhh... Paimon would rather not be on that list at all!",
            "About Hilichurls\t{NICKNAME}: Do you think that we're too harsh on the hilichurls?\\nPaimon: Well... sometimes we really do seem like children who just can't resist kicking the hornet's nest...\\n{NICKNAME}: I think we're doing more than just kicking it...",

Would you like to try them?\\n{NICKNAME}: Not going to try it yourself, Paimon?\\nPaimon: Paimon can sleep while floating! The air is the softest bed. Pretty sweet, huh?\\n{NICKNAME}: ...Just a little.",
            "About the Meaties\t{NICKNAME}: The \"Meaty tribe\"...? Hahaha, these hilichurls pick the funniest names.\\nPaimon: The hilichurls of the Meaty tribe make regular sacrifices.

It's an awesome wish, isn't it?\\n{NICKNAME}: ...I suppose I should have expected that answer.",
            "About the Eclipse Tribe\t{NICKNAME}: The \"Eclipse tribe\"... So the hilichurls have normal-sounding tribe names like these, too.\\nPaimon: The hilichurls of the Eclipse tribe are really mysterious.\\nPaimon: All the hilichurls of that tribe can draw an eclipse symbol.\\nPaimon: But rumor has it that only the Dada Samachurl of the Eclipse tribe knows why the eclipse symbol is so revered within their tribe.\\n{NICKNAME}: An eclipse symbol...\\nPaimon: Hmm? Did you say something, {NICKNAME}?\\n{NICKNAME}: Ah... I was... asking you what sort of soup you'd like to have tonight.\\nPaimon: Can't stop thinking about food, huh?

            "About Dietary Differences\t{NICKNAME}: Liyue's cuisine is very different from that of Mondstadt.\\n{NICKNAME}: For example, you can hardly find spicy fried dishes anywhere in Mondstadt.\\nPaimon: That's why they say \"climate creates cuisine,\" ya know?\\nPaimon: But wait... Why do all of Teyvat's slimes taste the same, then?\\n{NICKNAME}: That's because you only know one way of cooking them...",
            "About Saving Money\tPaimon: Wow, a weasel thief's backpack can really hide a lot of Mora!\\n{NICKNAME}: Well, it's because weasels, by nature, enjoy collecting shiny objects.\\nPaimon: Paimon's heard that the origin of the weasel thieves has something to do with the Treasure Hoarders...\\nPaimon: Also, aren't crows the type to collect shinies as well?\\nPaimon: Paimon wonders if Oz has a secret stash of Mora that he collects behind Fischl's back.\\n{NICKNAME}: Well, now that you mention it, Paimon...\\n{NICKNAME}: I wonder, do you—\\nPaimon:—Uhh...

            "About Paimon's Species\t{NICKNAME}: What monster made the deepest impression on you?\\nPaimon: Monsters, huh? Probably... Ruin Guards.\\n{NICKNAME}: Does a Ruin Guard really count as a monster? It's more like a machine...\\nPaimon: Paimon thinks that you can call anything that causes us trouble and needs to be defeated a \"monster.\"\\nPaimon: Just like how we call anything that can be hunted \"prey.\"\\n{NICKNAME}: Is that so... Well then, I think I'm finally able to classify you now, Paimon.\\nPaimon: Eh? What do you mean?\\n{NICKNAME}: You can be hooked and reeled in... therefore, you're a fish!\\nPaimon: Hmph!",

Haven't you seen that a ton already?\\nPaimon: But Paimon hasn't figured out how you do it yet. Could you explain it?\\n{NICKNAME}: Well, can you explain how you suddenly appear in front of me, and then disappear just as suddenly?\\nPaimon: Uh... well... Paimon seems to have always been able to do this. But Paimon doesn't know how...\\n{NICKNAME}: Precisely. I believe that the art of putting my weapon away follows the same principle.\\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe it's this similarity that makes us such good friends?",
            "About Chests\tPaimon: {NICKNAME}, what do you think of treasure chests?\\n{NICKNAME}: I believe that they were left behind by great travelers who once passed this way.\\n{NICKNAME}: Every time I open one and look at its contents, I can feel a certain kinship with those who came before...\\nPaimon: And that's how you get adventure experience!",

Paimon just thought of another one. This one's quite good—\\nPaimon: \"Just look at this visitor! Paimon, is it? Look at how cute and clever she is. Today, all her meals are on the house! *woof*\"\\n{NICKNAME}: There's no way Taroumaru would say something like that.\\nPaimon: Hee-hee...",
            "About Gorou\tPaimon: Hmm...\\n{NICKNAME}: What are you mulling over, Paimon?\\nPaimon: {NICKNAME}, do you remember Gorou's fluffy ears?\\nPaimon: Paimon really wants something like that... Or maybe horns similar to the ones Ganyu has. Ganyu's horns are pretty cute as well.\\nPaimon: {NICKNAME}, do you have any ideas?\\n{NICKNAME}: Let me see, hmm... Oh, I found something!\\nPaimon: Really? Aw, {NICKNAME}, Paimon always knew you were reliable!\\n{NICKNAME}: Ta-da! I present to you the Tusk of Monoceros Caeli!\\nPaimon: Paimon doesn't need that!\\nPaimon: *sigh* If Paimon can't have Gorou's fluffy ears, then maybe at least something like his fluffy tail...\\n{NICKNAME}: Bubadada! Here you go — Tail of Boreas!\\nPaimon: ...Not that! Also, combining those two is definitely not the look Paimon is going for!",
            "About Publishing Novels\tPaimon: It's amazing that Inazuma has places like the Yae Publishing House which specializes in publishing novels!\\nPaimon: They even host competitions! Wow!\\n{NICKNAME}: If that's the case, then perhaps you can submit a draft of the book you've been working on, \"Paimon's Happiness.\"\\nPaimon: Well, about that... Paimon has misplaced the drafts on our way to Inazuma...\\n{NICKNAME}: ...Really?\\nPaimon: Fine! Paimon hasn't started writing it yet...\\nPaimon: It's not Paimon's fault! Paimon's been meaning to do it but three days ago, Paimon's pen broke. The day before yesterday, Paimon had hand cramps. Yesterday — a sprained foot. Today... Paimon... Hmmm... Paimon's hungry!\\n{NICKNAME}: Hehe, it sounds like you'll sooner write \"A Thousand Excuses with Paimon\" than \"Paimon's Happiness.\"",
            "About Kaedehara Kazuha\tPaimon: Kazuha is a free spirit, wouldn't you say?\\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, he seems to be a bit of a loner too.\\nPaimon: Being able to explore the world at his leisure while savoring the beauty of everything around him. That doesn't sound too shabby...\\nPaimon: {NICKNAME}, you aren't thinking of sneaking off to go on a solo adventure, right?\\n{NICKNAME}: Aw, I would never leave you, Paimon.\\nPaimon: Paimon's really happy to hear that. Here... Hee—hee, have this...\\n{NICKNAME}: Monthly food expenses... 300,000 Mora!?\\nPaimon: Hey! Wait! {NICKNAME}, Where are you going?\\n{NICKNAME}: I suddenly feel like going solo. Maybe it's not a bad idea after all.\\nPaimon: Please don't go! Wait for Paimon!",
            "About Kamisato Ayaka\tPaimon: Hmmm...\\n{NICKNAME}: Paimon, you look so serious today.\\nPaimon: That's because Paimon's thinking about serious things.\\nPaimon: Paimon's jealous of people from wealthy and influential families. They have an endless supply of Mora and mountains of delicious food to eat...\\n{NICKNAME}: I can't disagree. Those are exactly the things you're fond of.\\nPaimon: But after getting to know Ayaka better, Paimon realized that a young lady from a noble family can also have her share of hardships.\\nPaimon: She needs to shoulder her clan's duties and responsibilities. She works so hard and has very little time for herself.\\nPaimon: Ayaka must be exhausted, she should try to relax a bit...\\nPaimon: Ah, that's right! Let's invite Ayaka to the next festival!\\nPaimon: If she got an invite from us, there's no way she'd refuse.\\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, I'd like to go to another festival with her.\\nPaimon: Besides, if Ayaka's around, she can pick up the tab for us...\\n{NICKNAME}: ...I should've seen that coming...",
            "About Imitating Ayaka\tPaimon: Ayaka gives a sense of noble elegance with every gesture she makes.\\n{NICKNAME}: Can you do an Ayaka impression, Paimon?\\nPaimon: Let's give it a try.\\nPaimon: \"Oh my, you've been picking mushrooms so earnestly just to make Chicken-Mushroom Skewers for me?\"\\nPaimon: \"How cute...\"\\n{NICKNAME}: That was nothing like Ayaka. But...\\n{NICKNAME}: Even though you didn't sound like yourself, it didn't feel completely out of place for you either...",
            "About Festival Traditions\tPaimon: It's a well-established tradition that during Inazuman celebrations everyone's wearing festive masks.\\nPaimon: Paimon tried to look around the stalls, but hasn't found any mask that fits...\\n{NICKNAME}: So you really want a mask of your own?\\nPaimon: Of course! Not wearing a mask during an Inazuman festival is the same as not receiving a bouquet at the Windblume Festival...\\n{NICKNAME}: Let me make one for you.\\nPaimon: Whoa! {NICKNAME}, you're the best!\\n{NICKNAME}: Hmmm, I wonder what kind of mask will fit you best? How about... a slime mask?\\nPaimon: Yay, Paimon Slime!",
            "About Yoimiya\tPaimon: Do you think Yoimiya's dad's poor hearing is related to fireworks?\\nPaimon: He's been making and testing fireworks for many years now, and being exposed to the sound of gunpowder explosions on a daily basis... Paimon can see how that might've worn down his ears...\\nPaimon: Yikes! Since Yoimiya is inheriting her family business, does that mean she'll have trouble hearing other people in the future, just like her dad?\\nPaimon: Paimon won't let that happen! Let's think of some way to help her!\\n{NICKNAME}: Do you have any suggestions, Paimon?\\nPaimon: Uh... Um...\\nPaimon: Paimon could follow Yoimiya around and cover her ears whenever needed...\\n{NICKNAME}: Then you'd need to leave me.\\nPaimon: ...Without Paimon, you'd lose your guide. Paimon wouldn't leave you like that!\\nPaimon: But... What should we do for Yoimiya...\\n{NICKNAME}: Actually, she can simply wear earplugs while working with fireworks.\\nPaimon: Oh yeah! Paimon didn't think of that solution! You're so smart!\\n{NICKNAME}: Heh... That was the first thing that came to my mind, but I wanted to give you an opportunity for a mental workout.\\nPaimon: Eh? So you knew this whole time, but didn't tell Paimon?\\nPaimon: How could you! You bully!",
            "About Sayu's Troubles\tPaimon: Sayu seems to have a lot on her mind.\\nPaimon: Paimon can't understand why she'd have so many worries.\\n{NICKNAME}: I guess this is what they call growing pains.\\nPaimon: Hmm, Paimon can't relate to that.\\nPaimon: After all, it's not Paimonly to worry too much.\\n{NICKNAME}: Hmmm...\\n{NICKNAME}: Bad news! We're almost out of Mora. I guess we'll have to tighten the purse strings for the next few days...\\nPaimon: Wh-What? Noooo!\\n{NICKNAME}: See, you're not as carefree as you thought.\\nPaimon: How could you prank Paimon like that...",
            "About Onikabuto\tPaimon: Those Onikabuto bugs look so scary! The patterns on their backs are terrifying!\\n{NICKNAME}: Do you mean those demonic patterns? It's because they don't like to fight, so they purposely evolved their patterns in a way that scares their enemies away.\\nPaimon: That's really smart. We should try to learn a thing or two from them!\\nPaimon: We could borrow Xiao's mask. If a hilichurl saw you wearing it, do you think they'd run in fear?\\n{NICKNAME}: Uh... I don't think Xiao would agree to that...\\nPaimon: Yeah... Hmm, how about we ask Sayu to steal his mask for us?\\nPaimon: She knows ninjutsu that allows her to vanish into thin air. She can steal it for sure! Problem solved!\\nPaimon: Uh... If we are afraid of Xiao evening the score with us, how about we steal Childe's mask? We've kicked his butt many times before!\\n{NICKNAME}: I don't think stealing other people's belongings is a good idea. Also, what if Sayu doesn't agree to all of this?\\nPaimon: Th—Then let's... Let's visit Albedo first.\\nPaimon: If Albedo can develop a growth serum for Sayu, she'll help us for sure!\\n{NICKNAME}: Brilliant, now we just need you to come up with a way to make Albedo help us.\\nPaimon: Ugh! Paimon's head is going to explode. Let's stick to festival masks for now.",
            "About Naku Weed\tPaimon: Even though Naku Weed has a flower-like structure, its \"petals\" are in fact leaves.\\nPaimon: Its actual bloom is rather fragile, so the surrounding leaves try their hardest to grow strong and protect it...\\nPaimon: Hee-hee, just like Paimon is protecting you right now.\\n{NICKNAME}: Just like you? Oh, is Naku Weed edible too?\\nPaimon: Yeah, that's right! ...Wait? What are you trying to say?",
            "About Naku Weed and Storms\tPaimon: Did you know? The people in Inazuma use the vibrations of Naku Weed to forecast thunderstorms.\\nPaimon: Because the Naku Weed grows in areas that are infused with Electro, it's naturally drawn to thunder and lightning.\\n{NICKNAME}: Does that mean Naku Weed is similar to you, Paimon?\\nPaimon: Eh? How so?\\n{NICKNAME}: You know, because you usually hang out in areas infused with gourmet food and are naturally drawn to tasty snacks!\\nPaimon: Hee-hee, that's true!\\n{NICKNAME}: Paimon radar activated...\\nPaimon: *beep* Delicacies, here we go!",
            "About Sakura Blooms\tPaimon: The blossoms drifting down from the Sacred Sakura are so dazzling!\\nPaimon: Paimon heard that those flower petals can stay suspended in the air for so long because of being infused with Electro.\\n{NICKNAME}: Is it the same principle behind your levitation abilities?\\nPaimon: Uh... Ah...That's because...\\n{NICKNAME}: You do know what allows you to fly, don't you, Paimon?\\nPaimon: Paimon can fly because of... mysterious powers, obviously!\\n{NICKNAME}: Got it. Seems like you have no idea.\\n{NICKNAME}: How about we let Albedo do some research? He's good at cracking such mysteries...\\nPaimon: Please don't!",
            "About Lavender Melons\tPaimon: Lavender Melons sure are useful!\\nPaimon: Their flesh can be eaten, and their skin can be processed to make dyes.\\n{NICKNAME}: Paimon sure is useful!\\n{NICKNAME}: She can serve as my guide, and she can also give other people ugly nicknames, haha.\\nPaimon: Yep! Thank you for your validation!\\nPaimon: Wait a minute, is there more? Is Paimon about to get roasted?\\nPaimon: Paimon's gonna cover your mouth to stop you from talking!",
            "About Swords\tPaimon: {NICKNAME}, have you noticed?\\nPaimon: In Inazuma, people who wear swords on their waists are a minority. Most soldiers use spears.\\nPaimon: Could it be that swords are a symbol of status... Should we wear them as well?\\nPaimon: But the swords here are all too big for Paimon... There's no other way, we'll have to find a famous swordsmith to make a custom one!\\n{NICKNAME}: A custom-made sword will cost a lot of Mora though.\\nPaimon: Are you saying that Mora is more important than the desires of your lovely companion?\\n{NICKNAME}: ...Actually, I've already prepared something for you, Paimon.\\nPaimon: Really? Really? Let's have a look!\\nPaimon: Hey! Isn't that the knife we use to cut fruit?\\n{NICKNAME}: Well, at least it's the right size for you...\\n{NICKNAME}: Ahem, \"What matters isn't the value of the sword, it's the fighting spirit.\"\\nPaimon: Nice try, but Paimon won't fall for this, no matter how cool it sounds!",
            "About Hot Springs\tPaimon: Did you know there are hot springs in Inazuma?\\n{NICKNAME}: ...But there are no volcanoes.\\nPaimon: Umm, Paimon heard that the heat comes from a giant furnace!\\nPaimon: If we get the chance, Paimon also wants to check out a hot spring. Unfortunately, it seems like only the big shots are granted entry.\\n{NICKNAME}: Hmmm...\\n{NICKNAME}: Let's head back to the Dadaupa Gorge in Mondstadt!\\nPaimon: Eh? Why so sudden?\\n{NICKNAME}: Back in the Dadaupa Gorge, the hilichurls have a huge cauldron that's heated by Flaming Flowers. It should be similar to a hot spring, right? You can bathe in their... soup, I guess?\\nPaimon: ???",
            "About Jugemu\tPaimon: In Inazuma, it's customary for parents to choose a lucky name for their child.\\n{NICKNAME}: Those names symbolize everyone's expectations and wishes for the child, like prosperity, wealth, good health, and safety.\\nPaimon: Because of these expectations, parents often pick extra long names, and cram all sorts of blessings into them.\\n{NICKNAME}: So hypothetically, if one day a little girl fell into a lake on her way back home, then her friends might rush to her house to tell everyone, \"Something bad happened!\"\\nPaimon: \"Oh, what happened?\"\\n{NICKNAME}: Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, Prinzessin der Verurteilung Fischl von Luftschloss Narfidort, come quick! Centennial Genius Astrologist Mona Megistus has fallen into the water!\\nPaimon: ...Mona falling into the water doesn't sound like an emergency situation though.\\n{NICKNAME}: Precisely. The fast-swimming Mona would come back home around the same time her friends are done saying her name, haha.",
            "About Inazuma's Islands\tPaimon: Inazuma's scenery is quite different than what we've seen so far.\\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, Inazuma's an island nation.\\nPaimon: Before the invention of boats, how did the people living on different islands communicate with one another?\\n{NICKNAME}: According to Yoimiya's dad, they probably used smoke signals to transmit information.\\n{NICKNAME}: Or, they would...\\nPaimon: Yeah...?\\n{NICKNAME}: They would commission people who could freeze the water surface to travel between the islands and deliver messages.\\nPaimon: Whoa! If Kaeya had lived in Inazuma back then, he would've been even busier than Master Jean now!",
            "About Tanuki\tPaimon: Tanuki are really mysterious creatures.\\n{NICKNAME}: I think they are really cute.\\nPaimon: Yeah, they're cute... until they start talking.\\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm, I wonder... If you couldn't talk, would you appear to be more mysterious and noble?\\nPaimon: Are you trying to mock me?\\n{NICKNAME}: *randomly humming innocently*",
            "About Tanuki and Their Illusions\tPaimon: Did anyone tell you that there are monsters called tanuki in Inazuma that can take on the form of any human they see?\\n{NICKNAME}: I heard such rumors before. They must know some mysterious transformation techniques.\\nPaimon: What if one day a tanuki tricked you by transforming into Paimon? Oh no... Paimon's worried now! \\n{NICKNAME}: No worries, I'd surely be able to tell the difference— Wait! You're just concerned about my Mora, aren't you?\\nPaimon: Of course... Ah! ...No, no! Paimon's only concerned about your safety, {NICKNAME}!\\nPaimon: Hmph, stop looking at Paimon like that. *pouting* Look, just think about it! If there were two Paimons, how would you find out which one is the real one?\\n{NICKNAME}: ...Eh-he.\\nPaimon: What do you mean \"eh-he\"!?\\n{NICKNAME}: See, only the real Paimon would respond like that.\\nPaimon: Ah! Paimon got tricked again...",
            "About Other Shrines\tPaimon: We've been passing by a lot of small shrines lately, but none of them seem to be dedicated to the Electro Archon.\\n{NICKNAME}: They were probably built for lesser deities. The people of Inazuma believe that everything around them has a spirit, and those spirits will help them in their time of need.\\nPaimon: Oh, so the people make shrines for them, and give them offerings.\\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah. In a way, it's a form of prayer and a token of appreciation.\\nPaimon: Paimon gets it now! Let's find Ayaka, and have her put up a shrine for us!\\nPaimon: If we do that, we'll be able to get lots of offerings as well!\\nPaimon: Paimon's so happy!\\n{NICKNAME}: Hehe. Uh... I—Is that an acceptable thing to do?\\nPaimon: What's wrong? Haven't we been helping out everyone this whole time? We may be doing an even better job than those deities!\\n{NICKNAME}: You do have a point...\\n{NICKNAME}: But when I picture people placing flowers or fruits in front of a shrine for me... it doesn't feel right.",
            "About the Rain on Yashiori Island\t{NICKNAME}: It never stops raining on Yashiori Island. I heard it's because of the lingering evil energy.\\nPaimon: \"Evil energy\"? What's that? Sounds terrifying.\\n{NICKNAME}: It's caused by the remains of an evil god somewhere on the island. Because its power hasn't fully dispersed, the remaining energy causes all sorts of misfortunes. That's what I meant when I said \"evil energy.\"\\nPaimon: Oh, that makes sense. But Paimon doesn't think rain is a bad thing.\\nPaimon: Maybe that god has been crying all this time because they were bullied.\\n{NICKNAME}: Crying? I don't think gods can cry. I mean, I've never seen Venti or Zhongli cry before.\\nPaimon: There are exceptions! If you pinch Paimon, you'll be able to see a crying god.\\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm? Are you a god?\\nPaimon: Paimon sure is!\\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, let me guess... The flying god of silly questions? The god of slimes? Or the god of being fished out from the water?\\nPaimon: Paimon's none of those! Hmph!\\nPaimon: As your bodyguard, {NICKNAME}, Paimon is the god of protection! Hehe.",
            "About Bantan Sango Detective Agency\t{NICKNAME}: In Hanamizaka, there's a place called the Bantan Sango Detective Agency.\\nPaimon: Paimon remembers. It's the one run by Sango and Ryuuji, right? Everyone speaks highly of them.\\n{NICKNAME}: Uh, I heard that they frequently get caught up in strange incidents, and some places have banned them from entering their premises...\\nPaimon: Paimon thinks that's undeserved. After all, Sango and Ryuuji have helped a lot of people...\\n{NICKNAME}: Would you invite them if you were organizing a dinner party?\\n{NICKNAME}: What if halfway through the meal, one of the guests suddenly shrieked and collapsed onto the ground...\\nPaimon: I—If that's the case, then Paimon thinks it's a bad idea. Paimon suddenly feels that hanging out with them could be dangerous...\\n{NICKNAME}: Well, that's the price you pay for being a famous detective.",
            "About the Windmills\tPaimon: Mondstadt has so many windmills, doesn't it?\\n{NICKNAME}: Well, the city is built above water, so it probably relies on windmills to draw the water upwards.\\nPaimon: That's correct! The winds blow through Mondstadt all year, so this supply of water is very stable.\\nPaimon: Also, the windmills are what they call \"visible winds\" — and wind chimes are called the \"audible winds.\"\\nPaimon: Paimon guesses they can be thought of as mascots and prayers to the Anemo Archon for protection.\\n{NICKNAME}: Ah, mascots. So, like you then, Paimon?\\nPaimon: No! Not at all! They're made of wood, and you can't eat them in an emergency either, 'cause all you'll do is grind your teeth down!\\n{NICKNAME}: Umm...\\n{NICKNAME}: ...I don't know what to say to that.",
            "About the Tavern Owner\t{NICKNAME}: I've heard that if you give tavern owners a considerable tip, they'll be willing to share some information on the down low.\\nPaimon: You mean the Angel's Share? But Master Diluc seems like a very rich man.\\nPaimon: How big a tip is \"considerable,\" anyway?\\n{NICKNAME}: Huh... Maybe I might have heard wrong.\\n{NICKNAME}: Or, maybe I might have heard this rumor in another world...\\nPaimon: You sure have been to many worlds, haven't you?",
            "About Cider Lake\tPaimon: Cider Lake never freezes, no matter what time of year it is.\\nPaimon: The best apple ciders in Mondstadt can only be made using the fresh water from this lake.\\nPaimon: It really does taste great! Paimon could drink two big bottles in a second!\\n{NICKNAME}: Wow.\\nPaimon: Tee-hee!\\n{NICKNAME}: With your size, I can't believe that you can drink that much liquid...\\n{NICKNAME}: ...And not explode like an Anemo Slime.\\nPaimon: Paimon has a special stomach just for tasty drinks!\\n{NICKNAME}: Huh... I guess the world really is a big place. So many things to consider...",
            "About the Library's Restricted Section\t{NICKNAME}: About those books in the \"restricted section\" that Lisa mentioned...\\n{NICKNAME}: Have you ever wondered what sort of books might be kept in there?\\n{NICKNAME}: Perhaps...\\n{NICKNAME}: ...It contains books not suitable for children?\\nPaimon: Huh? But \"The Boar Princess\" isn't in the restricted section!\\nPaimon: What could be more unsuitable for children than that? ...Hmm, Paimon's curious...",
            "About Effort and Reward\tPaimon: Paimon finds that hard work hardly works here in Mondstadt.\\n{NICKNAME}: Why do you say that?\\nPaimon: Just look at Huffman from the Knights of Favonius. He does his best at his duties every day...\\nPaimon: But the ever-relaxed Captain Kaeya is his boss.\\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... But isn't Jean, who works the hardest, the Acting Grand Master?\\nPaimon: W—Well, how about this, then...\\nPaimon: Venti's the god of Mondstadt, and he's the laziest of them all!",
            "About the Goth Grand Hotel\t{NICKNAME}: Ah... Sure would be nice to spend a night at the Goth Grand Hotel...\\nPaimon: Paimon thinks so too!\\nPaimon: The rooms are sure to be big and clean.\\n{NICKNAME}: Still, I've heard Mr. Goth say that they've had all kinds of strange problems ever since the Fatui moved in.\\n{NICKNAME}: The Electro Cicins that their mages brought in attracted a lot of dust with static electricity, which ended up killing a lot of those Cicins.\\n{NICKNAME}: Then, someone mixed up the Mist Grass Pollen and the pepper...\\n{NICKNAME}: And the Agents ended up brawling amongst themselves, each insisting that the other owed them money for wine.\\nPaimon: ...Hang in there, Goth Grand Hotel...",
            "About the Way the Wind Blows\t{NICKNAME}: Everyone says that Mondstadt is the land of the wind.\\n{NICKNAME}: But, I wonder which direction the seasonal winds come from.\\nPaimon: Why don't we ask Venti?\\n{NICKNAME}: He'll probably just dodge the question with a \"hehe\" or something...\\nPaimon: True. The Anemo Archon is just a Tone-Deaf Bard. What does he know about the wind?",
            "About Alchemy\t{NICKNAME}: So here in Mondstadt, alchemy is practiced out on the streets?\\nPaimon: Is that so strange?\\n{NICKNAME}: In many of the worlds I've been to in the past, alchemy has always been a secretive art.\\n{NICKNAME}: Watching alchemy being practiced as a part of daily life is like being in a world where people all have three stomachs...\\nPaimon: Paimon thinks only having one stomach is weird!\\n{NICKNAME}: Uh...\\n{NICKNAME}: Are you serious?\\nPaimon: What do you think?",
            "About Teyvat\t{NICKNAME}: Teyvat's day and night both seem particularly short.\\n{NICKNAME}: The skies here are full of stars, but they aren't the same as the ones back home.\\n{NICKNAME}: I wonder if the fates of people from Teyvat are also related to their constellations.\\nPaimon: Oh? Do you know how to read the stars, too? That's amazing! Not a lot of people outside Sumeru can do it.\\nPaimon: Paimon's curious! Come on, do a reading for me, quick!\\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm...\\n{NICKNAME}: The night sky pictured on Paimon's cape... flows with the light of many stars, and also of the deep ocean...\\n{NICKNAME}: The movement of these stars... tells me that, uh... in, say, seven days from now...\\nPaimon: ...In seven days what?\\n{NICKNAME}: Something good, or something bad, might occur...\\nPaimon: Heh, right... your theory sounds as rock solid as a Geo Slime... And about as brainy, too.",
            "About the God of Freedom\t{NICKNAME}: On the way back to Mondstadt after rescuing Dvalin...\\n{NICKNAME}: We finally got to see one of the Seven Archons, didn't we? It was interesting to see what kind of god he was.\\nPaimon: Hmm... Haven't we known Venti for quite a while now?\\n{NICKNAME}: As Venti, yes... But still, this was the first time that we got to see him as the Anemo Archon, Barbatos.\\n{NICKNAME}: Normally, he hides his true divinity behind the facade of a bard.\\n{NICKNAME}: \"What does freedom really mean, when demanded of you by a god?\"\\n{NICKNAME}: That was the question that he asked Dvalin... I'm still contemplating that... you know?",
            "About Mondstadt's Terrain\tPaimon: Mondstadt is full of wide plains and rolling hills.\\nPaimon: People say that when Barbatos made this land, he used the storm to flatten the cliffs and valleys...\\n{NICKNAME}: Still, it looks like he missed a few spots.\\nPaimon: Like Starsnatch Cliff?\\n{NICKNAME}: Exactly.\\n{NICKNAME}: On the map, it almost looks as if it was meant to be the apex of a vertical structure, but ended up at the wrong orientation.\\nPaimon: Wh—What's an \"apex\"?",
            "About Couplets\tPaimon: Paimon's heard that couplets are a traditional art form in Liyue. If you can write a line that works as a second half to one that someone else has written, you'll be well paid!\\nPaimon: But linking the couplet is hard, so it's not easy money.\\nPaimon: Not only does the rhythm need to match, but the meaning has to as well.\\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm... Care to give an example?\\nPaimon: Uh... \"Windrise's winds never churn.\"\\n{NICKNAME}: ...Um, \"But the Sea of Clouds' clouds always return.\"\\nPaimon: Huh... Not bad!\\nPaimon: Let's not waste time here. We've got some money to make!",
            "About \"Don't Play With Food, or With Money\"\tPaimon: There's a saying of Rex Lapis' that's commonly used here in Liyue. Paimon thinks its rough meaning is... \"Don't play with your money.\"\\nPaimon: It's because the first Mora were minted from his golden form and given to humans in trust.\\n{NICKNAME}: Kaeya sure seems to enjoy playing with his money...\\nPaimon: And that's why you shouldn't learn from him.\\n{NICKNAME}: Well, as a child, I was taught not to play with my food.\\nPaimon: Yup, yup. You've got to respect your food.\\nPaimon: ...Wh—What are you looking at Paimon for?",

Paimon is just trying to see if that antique shop from \"Heart's Desire\" actually exists!\\n{NICKNAME}: Well, assuming that a shop in a story does exist, what would you like to buy, Paimon?\\nPaimon: A Slime Creator!\\n{NICKNAME}: Does such a thing even exist?",
            "About the Guhua Clan\t{NICKNAME}: Lately, some Guhua Clan disciples have been retelling an ancient story.\\nPaimon: The Guhua Clan, huh? Paimon bets it's a heroic story!\\n{NICKNAME}: Several female disciples decided to partake of a contest of arms to see who would marry their male junior, and he approved.\\nPaimon: Ooh, Paimon's heard this one. In Liyue, they call this \"a joust for a spouse\"!\\n{NICKNAME}: But the night before the contest, he stole the eldest disciple's favorite sword.\\nPaimon: Ah, so he wanted her to lose... Poor girl...\\n{NICKNAME}: I know, right? Forced to use a sword she wasn't used to, the eldest disciple suffered a crushing defeat.\\n{NICKNAME}: Unable to accept this result, she fell to her knees and wept.\\nPaimon: Oh no... She must have really loved him, right?\\n{NICKNAME}: In the end, she was forced to marry him in front of everyone. Hahaha.\\nPaimon: Wait... so the loser had to marry him!?",
            "About Dihua Marsh\tPaimon: Did you know the reeds in Dihua Marsh are common materials used in making paper?\\nPaimon: The solid reed cores are used to make pens, while the hollow part is used to make flutes. It's all very sophisticated.\\nPaimon: Over the years, many heroes and swordsmen have also chosen Dihua Marsh as the location of their duels.\\nPaimon: The more reeds, the more elegant the place. But in places where the reeds are the thickest, the water can be quite deep...\\nPaimon: So there are a lot of unlucky duelists who fall in and drown while the duel is on...\\n{NICKNAME}: Huh. And what's my takeaway from all of this supposed to be?\\nPaimon: Don't get into a fight in Dihua Marsh!",
            "About the Gentleman Bird\tPaimon: Paimon's heard that in Liyue, people call the crane the \"gentleman bird.\"\\n{NICKNAME}: And do you know why that is?\\nPaimon: Hmm... Paimon's not quite sure...\\n{NICKNAME}: Well then, let me tell you about the story of the lucky crane repaying its debts.\\n{NICKNAME}: A long, long time ago, there was a kind-hearted scholar who saved a lucky crane that had fallen into a trap.\\n{NICKNAME}: Later, on a cold winter's night, a beautiful maiden came to his door, asking to lodge with him.\\n{NICKNAME}: The maiden shouldered a greatsword on her back, and taught all that she knew of swordsmanship to the scholar, supervising him as he studied day and night.\\nPaimon: Whoa...\\n{NICKNAME}: Once he had finished his training, he went out into the wilds with the maiden to do good and fight for justice.\\n{NICKNAME}: Ten years later, the lucky crane took the form of a gentleman, and finally came to return the favor, but discovered the couple had already lived out a fortuitous life...\\n{NICKNAME}: And that's the story known as \"The Gentleman's 10-Year Debt.\"\\nPaimon: Ahh...",
            "About Jueyun Karst\t{NICKNAME}: Rumor has it that Jueyun Karst is the abode of the adepti.\\nPaimon: Wow — the abode of the adepti!\\n{NICKNAME}: Perhaps we'll meet the adepti on those cloud-piercing mountain peaks.\\nPaimon: Wow — meeting adepti!\\n{NICKNAME}: But I wonder... how would one normally communicate with the adepti?\\nPaimon: Wow — communicating with adepti!\\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm. My emergency rations seem to be going bad. *sigh* Best to consume them quickly...\\nPaimon: Ahem. Well... Paimon thinks that shouting from the mountaintop should work.\\n{NICKNAME}: That seems more like a way for getting the attention of a hilichurl instead of an adeptus.",
            "About the God of Contracts\t{NICKNAME}: To think that the Geo Archon had signed a contract with the Cryo Archon.\\n{NICKNAME}: I wonder what the contents of their agreement were...\\nPaimon: Paimon doesn't care who you are, making a deal with the Tsaritsa is super dangerous!\\n{NICKNAME}: Be that as it may...\\n{NICKNAME}: Since Morax is the god who understands the basis of contracts the best...\\n{NICKNAME}: He's definitely given this some thought.\\nPaimon: Well that's true. Morax himself called it the \"contract to end all contracts\"...\\n{NICKNAME}: I trust that we will witness the truth, and its denouement, play out...",
            "About Divine Predictions in Liyue\tPaimon: Come to think of it, while Rex Lapis enjoys visiting his people in private, he only descends officially once every year.\\nPaimon: None of the other gods do this. Hmm... Does Rex Lapis have any deeper intentions?\\n{NICKNAME}: I have my guesses...\\n{NICKNAME}: You see, those annual divine predictions have already captured the hearts of the people of Liyue too much.\\n{NICKNAME}: Round and around they analyze and scrutinize every single word, finding limitless \"hidden meanings\" within them...\\n{NICKNAME}: What do you think would happen to Liyue if such divine predictions were available every day?\\nPaimon: Ah!\\nPaimon: Paimon gets it now. Paimon would be offering Rex Lapis' favorite snacks to him every day!\\nPaimon: If you could just get Mora straight from Morax's hands, who would ever need to do a day of honest work?\\n{NICKNAME}: You made... some logical leaps, but that's basically how it is.",
            "About Benny's Adventure Team\tPaimon: If you want to adventure together with Benny's Adventure Team, you have to come prepared.\\nPaimon: Domains are very dangerous, so you should always take care to double- and triple-check your supplies in advance.\\nPaimon: Paimon's heard that the Adventurers' Guild has compiled a list of 463 different ways of dying in these domains...\\nPaimon: If Bennett got you killed by accident, Paimon and Bennett would never forgive ourselves!\\n{NICKNAME}: ...Why am I the only one dying here?\\nPaimon: Well, that's because according to the numbers, Paimon can avoid 322 causes of death just by floating!\\n{NICKNAME}: I suddenly don't feel like exploring these domains...",
            "About Bennett\t{NICKNAME}: I've heard that Albert, being the leader of Barbara's fan club...\\n{NICKNAME}: ...Sometimes gets bumps and bruises on purpose so that he can go to the Cathedral to see her.\\nPaimon: Paimon feels the Knights of Favonius should keep a closer watch on weirdos like that.\\n{NICKNAME}: But it seems that a month later, Albert discovered that Bennett was managing to see Barbara far more than he was.\\n{NICKNAME}: On second thought, Bennett does have the natural advantage when it comes to getting injured.\\nPaimon: What is this, a \"let's bother Barbara\" contest?",
            "About the \"Idol\"\tPaimon: Barbara's really popular, isn't she?\\n{NICKNAME}: Well, she is the idol of the people of Mondstadt.\\nPaimon: Come to think of it... Paimon doesn't really know what an \"idol\" is.\\n{NICKNAME}: It's an occupation in which one's work is to be cute, be well-loved, and earn a boat-load of Mora.\\nPaimon: Isn't that the same thing as being a mascot?\\n{NICKNAME}: That's... one way to put it.",
            "About Being Sisters\t{NICKNAME}: Lisa and Amber feel a bit like sisters.\\nPaimon: Huh? Why's that?\\n{NICKNAME}: Amber often runs errands for Lisa. Older siblings asking their younger siblings to do things for them so they can slack off is a rather common practice...\\n{NICKNAME}: But, my brother and I are the same age, so we had to decide these things via rock-paper-scissors.\\nPaimon. Whoa. So, doesn't that make you my younger sister?\\n{NICKNAME}: What do you mean?\\nPaimon: Well, since Paimon floats, you're the only one who can \"run\" any errands!\\n{NICKNAME}: ...Seriously?",

Maybe he'll even get a weird nickname!\\nPaimon: Like, say, \"Pasty Eye\"!\\n{NICKNAME}: Guess he didn't need to take it off to get a weird nickname...",
            "About Kaeya and Diluc\tPaimon: Strange...\\n{NICKNAME}: What's wrong?\\nPaimon: Diluc and Kaeya are really alike, so why don't they get along?\\n{NICKNAME}: How are they alike, again?\\nPaimon: Well, Kaeya's the kind of guy who acts shady in the light of day...\\nPaimon: While Diluc is a shining beacon of justice in the dark of night!\\nPaimon: Don't you think that's kinda the same thing...?\\n{NICKNAME}: Uhh... I still don't see it.",
            "About Measuring Fighting Strength\t{NICKNAME}: If one hilichurl could beat, say, three wild boars...\\n{NICKNAME}: Then how many hilichurls would it take to reach the fighting prowess of Master Jean and Master Diluc?\\nPaimon: Not sure... but if you heard the way everyone talks in Mondstadt, you'd know that Master Jean is the strongest.\\n{NICKNAME}: I'd say that if Diluc strikes first, Master Jean wouldn't be able to counter.\\nPaimon: Oh, she'd find a way.\\n{NICKNAME}: There's no way.\\nPaimon: Master Jean's Elemental Burst is really strong, you know~\\n{NICKNAME}: Yes, but that \"field\" would also make Diluc stronger.\\nPaimon: Paimon doesn't think Master Jean would even need her Vision to take on Master Diluc, because—\\n{NICKNAME}: Diluc would only need a beginner's greatsword to—\\nPaimon: Argh...\\n{NICKNAME}: Ugh...\\n{NICKNAME}: *sigh* This... is so dumb.\\n{NICKNAME}: They both fight for Mondstadt, so they wouldn't come to blows.\\nPaimon: That's why Paimon likes your idea of measuring their fighting strength in number of hilichurls.\\nPaimon: ...Or in Paimon's case, in fifths of a wild boar.",
            "About Razor\tPaimon: {NICKNAME}, you know what a brush is, right?\\n{NICKNAME}: Of course! Kinda like pens but with animal hair at one end for calligraphy, right?\\nPaimon: That's correct! They say that finely-made brushes sell for high prices among Liyue's merchants!\\n{NICKNAME}: So, would you like to make some too?\\nPaimon: Uh-huh! But wild wolves are too fierce, so we should use Razor's fur to make brushes instead!\\nPaimon: Razor's fur is all downy and soft. It'll definitely make great wolf-fur brushes! We could make lots of Mora like this!\\n{NICKNAME}: Brushes made like that would conduct electricity. I'm not sure we could use them.\\n{NICKNAME}: Besides, Razor isn't a wolf, nor are wolf brushes made from actual wolves' fur...\\nPaimon: Huh? Why are they called wolf-fur brushes, then?\\n{NICKNAME}: Well, does Cider Lake look like it's full of cider to you?\\nPaimon: Hmm. You have a point.",
            "About Klee\tPaimon: Klee's a really interesting kid.\\nPaimon: All the Knights seem to like her a lot, too. You could even say they spoil her.\\n{NICKNAME}: I wonder, who makes the better mascot: Paimon, or Klee?\\n{NICKNAME}: Oh wait, I forgot. Paimon's not a mascot, Paimon is emergency—\\nPaimon: Hey! Paimon knows exactly what you're going to say. That joke stopped being funny a long time ago.",
            "About the \"Wondermaid\"\tPaimon: It's time for Paimon's Little Life Tips!\\n{NICKNAME}: \"Little Life Tips\"?\\nPaimon: In Mondstadt, if there's something you can't fix, or there's something you can't get clean no matter what you do...\\nPaimon: If you ever run into something you can't handle yourself, you just need to shout this name into the skies:\\nPaimon: \"Noeeeelle!\"\\nPaimon: And everything that's troubling you will be swept away in an instant.\\n{NICKNAME}: So this is one of the tricks to living in Mondstadt... Pretty impressive...",
            "About Fischl\tPaimon: Fischl makes a very unique impression, doesn't she?\\n{NICKNAME}: How so?\\nPaimon: Well, she travels together with a talking raven, for starters.\\n{NICKNAME}: Well, I'm traveling with you. It's not all that different.\\n{NICKNAME}: Still, Oz can also translate for Fischl. You, on the other hand...\\nPaimon: What!? Paimon's way better than some bird!\\n{NICKNAME}: Haha, how so?\\nPaimon: Well, um... uh... at least Paimon doesn't need wings to fly!",
            "About Pets\t{NICKNAME}: Speaking of Fischl, she also claims to be a \"visitor from another world\"...\\n{NICKNAME}: We're similar in that way. We even bring a pet along with us.\\nPaimon: Pet? Now, wait just a minute, here...\\n{NICKNAME}: But her raven, Oz... He looks cool, and is polite to boot.\\n{NICKNAME}: More importantly, he can both scout and fight — very useful indeed.\\n{NICKNAME}: Maybe I should make arrangements with Fischl to trade companions once in a while for, say, a week or two at a time? Hehe, it should be quite interesting.\\nPaimon: Hey! Doesn't Paimon get a say in this!?",
            "About Beidou\tPaimon: How do you become as popular and cool as Captain Beidou?\\n{NICKNAME}: With enough experience...?\\nPaimon: Paimon's already seen lots of things from adventuring together with you!\\n{NICKNAME}: One also needs to experience trials and setbacks...\\nPaimon: Paimon almost drowned that one time...\\n{NICKNAME}: ...And maintain an inspirational disposition...\\nPaimon: Uh-huh! Paimon's always rooted for you!\\n{NICKNAME}: One must also have a... mature outlook towards problems.\\nPaimon: Hey! Are you just trying to say that Paimon can't make it?",
            "About Ningguang\tPaimon: How does a person become as rich... no, as super rich as Lady Ningguang?\\n{NICKNAME}: Hah... Is that the only impression she gives you? Riches?\\nPaimon: Well, there's the huge Jade Chamber, too! But isn't that also made of Mora?\\n{NICKNAME}: Well, you need an excellent mind...\\nPaimon: Well... Paimon's really good at giving people nicknames!\\n{NICKNAME}: You need to be very familiar with the workings of the markets...\\nPaimon: A serving of Fisherman's Toast goes for 1,025 Mora, and no discounts — even on rainy days.\\n{NICKNAME}: You also need to be willing to work really hard...\\nPaimon: Okay then... so, how do you make friends with a really rich person?\\n{NICKNAME}: Wait, you're giving up already!?",

As expected of a traveler, you really know a lot!\\nPaimon: So, what special things can zombies do?\\n{NICKNAME}: Exercises?\\nPaimon: Ah, that makes a lot of sense!

They're all very tasty!\\n{NICKNAME}: Tasty, huh...\\nPaimon: Turning slimes into bubbly, lovely, jubbly meals is the Paimon Special!\\n{NICKNAME}: Well then...\\n{NICKNAME}: I suppose that's one more thing I can eat before you become emergency rations, huh, Paimon?\\nPaimon: Uhh... Paimon would rather not be on that list at all!",

So the hilichurls have normal-sounding tribe names like these, too.\\nPaimon: The hilichurls of the Eclipse tribe are really mysterious.\\nPaimon: All the hilichurls of that tribe can draw an eclipse symbol.\\nPaimon: But rumor has it that only the Dada Samachurl of the Eclipse tribe knows why the eclipse symbol is so revered within their tribe.\\n{NICKNAME}: An eclipse symbol...\\nPaimon: Hmm? Did you say something, {NICKNAME}?\\n{NICKNAME}: Ah... I was... asking you what sort of soup you'd like to have tonight.\\nPaimon: Can't stop thinking about food, huh?

            "About Dietary Differences\t{NICKNAME}: Liyue's cuisine is very different from that of Mondstadt.\\n{NICKNAME}: For example, in Mondstadt you can hardly find spicy fried dishes anywhere.\\nPaimon: That's why they say \"climate creates cuisine,\" ya know?\\nPaimon: But wait... Why do all of Teyvat's slimes taste the same, then?\\n{NICKNAME}: That's because you only know one way of cooking them...",

            "Joining Party: III\tThere's still a long road ahead.",
            "About the Vision Hunt Decree\tPaimon: It's hard to talk about the recent events in Inazuma and not mention the Vision Hunt Decree.\\nPaimon: But you don't have a Vision, so you don't have to worry about losing one.\\nPaimon: On the flip side, if you are caught by the Tenryou Commission, {NICKNAME}, you also can't surrender your Vision in exchange for your life...\\n{NICKNAME}: I can tell them that you are my Vision.\\nPaimon: Another reason to have Paimon around... Wait, WHAT!?\\n{NICKNAME}: Don't worry, I wouldn't let them take you, Paimon.\\nPaimon: That's more like it.\\n{NICKNAME}: We'd just go to jail and suffer punishment together...\\nPaimon: Uh... W—Well, if that's how it would go down, then maybe you should hand me over to them...\\nPaimon: ...Wait a minute! How about we just don't get caught in the first place?",
            "About the Resistance\tPaimon: Only the ones who have the will to fight back are allowed into the Resistance!\\nPaimon: Huh. In that case, Paimon also qualifies as a member.\\n{NICKNAME}: And what exactly are you trying to resist, Paimon?\\nPaimon: Paimon has been resolutely fighting against the fate of being squished all this time!\\n{NICKNAME}: Then you probably won't get in.\\nPaimon: Why? Is it because Paimon isn't fighting for the same cause as the Resistance?\\n{NICKNAME}: It's because you're fighting for a lost cause, I'm afraid...\\nPaimon: *sob* Y—You meanie!",
            "About Kamuijima Cannons\tPaimon: Kamuileon... Cannon? Kamuijuicy... Cannon? Kamuijimmy... Cannon? Ugh... What a mouthful.\\n{NICKNAME}: What are you reading, Paimon?\\nPaimon: Look, it's the super weapon the Shogunate army has constructed nearby to protect Tatarasuna.\\nPaimon:  Kamuijima! Cannon!\\n{NICKNAME}：It looks really powerful... And yet, we didn't see it do anything while we were in Tatarasuna.\\nPaimon: It seems like the Resistance knew how strong it was, so before formally waging war against the Shogunate, they had covertly occupied this place.\\nPaimon: But this Kamui... Kamuijima Cannon needs either special ammunition or Electro to work, so it's no use to the Resistance.\\nPaimon: The Shogunate army put so much time and effort into creating this weapon... Paimon really wants to see the extent of its power.\\n{NICKNAME}: If all you need is an Electro user, perhaps I can help.\\nPaimon: That's right! Now we just need something that would serve as our cannon ball...\\nPaimon: Huh? ...Why are you giving me that look? Hey—",
            "About Taroumaru\tPaimon: You know what? When we first arrived at the Komore Teahouse, Paimon really thought that Taroumaru would be able to speak...\\n{NICKNAME}: You sound a bit disappointed.\\nPaimon: Of course! If Taroumaru could speak, Paimon feels that he'd say something really interesting!\\n{NICKNAME}: For example?\\nPaimon: Hmm... \"Thoma, stop hiding around here, you're in my way! *woof*\"\\n{NICKNAME}: That makes sense.\\nPaimon: Or... \"Kozue, you're bound to me for the rest of your life, unless our contract is terminated! *woof* *woof*\"\\n{NICKNAME}: You didn't believe Kozue when she said she'd signed a secret contract forcing her to work part-time at the Teahouse, did you?\\nPaimon: Oh! Paimon just thought of another one. This one's quite good—\\nPaimon: \"Just look at this visitor! Paimon, is it? Look at how cute and clever she is. Today, all her meals are on the house! *woof*\"\\n{NICKNAME}: There's no way Taroumaru would say something like that.\\nPaimon: Hee-hee...",
            "About Gorou\tPaimon: Hmm...\\n{NICKNAME}: What are you mulling over, Paimon?\\nPaimon: {NICKNAME}, do you remember Gorou's fluffy ears?\\nPaimon: Paimon really wants something like that... Or maybe horns similar to the ones Ganyu has. Ganyu's horns are pretty cute as well.\\nPaimon: {NICKNAME}, do you have any ideas?\\n{NICKNAME}: Let me see, hmm... Oh, I found something!\\nPaimon: Really? Aw, {NICKNAME}, Paimon always knew you were reliable!\\n{NICKNAME}: Ta-da! I present to you the Tusk of Monoceros Caeli!\\nPaimon: Paimon doesn't need that!\\nPaimon: *sigh* If Paimon can't have Gorou's fluffy ears, then maybe at least something like his fluffy tail...\\n{NICKNAME}: Bubadada! Here you go — Tail of Boreas!\\nPaimon: ...Not that! Also, combining those two is definitely not the look Paimon is going for!",
            "About Publishing Novels\tPaimon: It's amazing that Inazuma has places like the Yae Publishing House which specializes in publishing novels!\\nPaimon: They even host competitions! Wow!\\n{NICKNAME}: If that's the case, then perhaps you can submit a draft of the book you've been working on, \"Paimon's Happiness.\"\\nPaimon: Well, about that... Paimon has misplaced the drafts on our way to Inazuma...\\n{NICKNAME}: ...Really?\\nPaimon: Fine! Paimon hasn't started writing it yet...\\nPaimon: It's not Paimon's fault! Paimon's been meaning to do it but three days ago, Paimon's pen broke. The day before yesterday, Paimon had hand cramps. Yesterday — a sprained foot. Today... Paimon... Hmmm... Paimon's hungry!\\n{NICKNAME}: Hehe, it sounds like you'll sooner write \"A Thousand Excuses with Paimon\" than \"Paimon's Happiness.\"",
            "About Kaedehara Kazuha\tPaimon: Kazuha is a free spirit, wouldn't you say?\\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, he seems to be a bit of a loner too.\\nPaimon: Being able to explore the world at his leisure while savoring the beauty of everything around him. That doesn't sound too shabby...\\nPaimon: {NICKNAME}, you aren't thinking of sneaking off to go on a solo adventure, right?\\n{NICKNAME}: Aw, I would never leave you, Paimon.\\nPaimon: Paimon's really happy to hear that. Here... Hee—hee, have this...\\n{NICKNAME}: Monthly food expenses... 300,000 Mora!?\\nPaimon: Hey! Wait! {NICKNAME}, Where are you going?\\n{NICKNAME}: I suddenly feel like going solo. Maybe it's not a bad idea after all.\\nPaimon: Please don't go! Wait for Paimon!",
            "About Kamisato Ayaka\tPaimon: Hmmm...\\n{NICKNAME}: Paimon, you look so serious today.\\nPaimon: That's because Paimon's thinking about serious things.\\nPaimon: Paimon's jealous of people from wealthy and influential families. They have an endless supply of Mora and mountains of delicious food to eat...\\n{NICKNAME}: I can't disagree. Those are exactly the things you're fond of.\\nPaimon: But after getting to know Ayaka better, Paimon realized that a young lady from a noble family can also have her share of hardships.\\nPaimon: She needs to shoulder her clan's duties and responsibilities. She works so hard and has very little time for herself.\\nPaimon: Ayaka must be exhausted, she should try to relax a bit...\\nPaimon: Ah, that's right! Let's invite Ayaka to the next festival!\\nPaimon: If she got an invite from us, there's no way she'd refuse.\\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, I'd like to go to another festival with her.\\nPaimon: Besides, if Ayaka's around, she can pick up the tab for us...\\n{NICKNAME}: ...I should've seen that coming...",
            "About Imitating Ayaka\tPaimon: Ayaka gives a sense of noble elegance with every gesture she makes.\\n{NICKNAME}: Can you do an Ayaka impression, Paimon?\\nPaimon: Let's give it a try.\\nPaimon: \"Oh my, you've been picking mushrooms so earnestly just to make Chicken-Mushroom Skewers for me?\"\\nPaimon: \"How cute...\"\\n{NICKNAME}: That was nothing like Ayaka. But...\\n{NICKNAME}: Even though you didn't sound like yourself, it didn't feel completely out of place for you either...",
            "About Festival Traditions\tPaimon: It's a well-established tradition that during Inazuman celebrations everyone's wearing festive masks.\\nPaimon: Paimon tried to look around the stalls, but hasn't found any mask that fits...\\n{NICKNAME}: So you really want a mask of your own?\\nPaimon: Of course! Not wearing a mask during an Inazuman festival is the same as not receiving a bouquet at the Windblume Festival...\\n{NICKNAME}: Let me make one for you.\\nPaimon: Whoa! {NICKNAME}, you're the best!\\n{NICKNAME}: Hmmm, I wonder what kind of mask will fit you best? How about... a slime mask?\\nPaimon: Yay, Paimon Slime!",
            "About Yoimiya\tPaimon: Do you think Yoimiya's dad's poor hearing is related to fireworks?\\nPaimon: He's been making and testing fireworks for many years now, and being exposed to the sound of gunpowder explosions on a daily basis... Paimon can see how that might've worn down his ears...\\nPaimon: Yikes! Since Yoimiya is inheriting her family business, does that mean she'll have trouble hearing other people in the future, just like her dad?\\nPaimon: Paimon won't let that happen! Let's think of some way to help her!\\n{NICKNAME}: Do you have any suggestions, Paimon?\\nPaimon: Uh... Um...\\nPaimon: Paimon could follow Yoimiya around and cover her ears whenever needed...\\n{NICKNAME}: Then you'd need to leave me.\\nPaimon: ...Without Paimon, you'd lose your guide. Paimon wouldn't leave you like that!\\nPaimon: But... What should we do for Yoimiya...\\n{NICKNAME}: Actually, she can simply wear earplugs while working with fireworks.\\nPaimon: Oh yeah! Paimon didn't think of that solution! You're so smart!\\n{NICKNAME}: Heh... That was the first thing that came to my mind, but I wanted to give you an opportunity for a mental workout.\\nPaimon: Eh? So you knew this whole time, but didn't tell Paimon?\\nPaimon: How could you! You bully!",
            "About Sayu's Troubles\tPaimon: Sayu seems to have a lot on her mind.\\nPaimon: Paimon can't understand why she'd have so many worries.\\n{NICKNAME}: I guess this is what they call growing pains.\\nPaimon: Hmm, Paimon can't relate to that.\\nPaimon: After all, it's not Paimonly to worry too much.\\n{NICKNAME}: Hmmm...\\n{NICKNAME}: Bad news! We're almost out of Mora. I guess we'll have to tighten the purse strings for the next few days...\\nPaimon: Wh-What? Noooo!\\n{NICKNAME}: See, you're not as carefree as you thought.\\nPaimon: How could you prank Paimon like that...",
            "About Onikabuto\tPaimon: Those Onikabuto bugs look so scary! The patterns on their backs are terrifying!\\n{NICKNAME}: Do you mean those demonic patterns? It's because they don't like to fight, so they purposely evolved their patterns in a way that scares their enemies away.\\nPaimon: That's really smart. We should try to learn a thing or two from them!\\nPaimon: We could borrow Xiao's mask. If a hilichurl saw you wearing it, do you think they'd run in fear?\\n{NICKNAME}: Uh... I don't think Xiao would agree to that...\\nPaimon: Yeah... Hmm, how about we ask Sayu to steal his mask for us?\\nPaimon: She knows ninjutsu that allows her to vanish into thin air. She can steal it for sure! Problem solved!\\nPaimon: Uh... If we are afraid of Xiao evening the score with us, how about we steal Childe's mask? We've kicked his butt many times before!\\n{NICKNAME}: I don't think stealing other people's belongings is a good idea. Also, what if Sayu doesn't agree to all of this?\\nPaimon: Th—Then let's... Let's visit Albedo first.\\nPaimon: If Albedo can develop a growth serum for Sayu, she'll help us for sure!\\n{NICKNAME}: Brilliant, now we just need you to come up with a way to make Albedo help us.\\nPaimon: Ugh! Paimon's head is going to explode. Let's stick to festival masks for now.",
            "About Naku Weed\tPaimon: Even though Naku Weed has a flower-like structure, its \"petals\" are in fact leaves.\\nPaimon: Its actual bloom is rather fragile, so the surrounding leaves try their hardest to grow strong and protect it...\\nPaimon: Hee-hee, just like Paimon is protecting you right now.\\n{NICKNAME}: Just like you? Oh, is Naku Weed edible too?\\nPaimon: Yeah, that's right! ...Wait? What are you trying to say?",
            "About Naku Weed and Storms\tPaimon: Did you know? The people in Inazuma use the vibrations of Naku Weed to forecast thunderstorms.\\nPaimon: Because the Naku Weed grows in areas that are infused with Electro, it's naturally drawn to thunder and lightning.\\n{NICKNAME}: Does that mean Naku Weed is similar to you, Paimon?\\nPaimon: Eh? How so?\\n{NICKNAME}: Because you usually hang out in areas infused with gourmet food and are naturally drawn to tasty snacks!\\nPaimon: Hee-hee, that's true!\\n{NICKNAME}: Paimon radar activated...\\nPaimon: *beep* Delicacies, here we go!",
            "About Sakura Blooms\tPaimon: The blossoms drifting down from the Sacred Sakura are so dazzling!\\nPaimon: Paimon heard that those flower petals can stay suspended in the air for so long because of being infused with Electro.\\n{NICKNAME}: Is it the same principle behind your levitation abilities?\\nPaimon: Uh... Ah...That's because...\\n{NICKNAME}: You do know what allows you to fly, don't you, Paimon?\\nPaimon: Paimon can fly because of... mysterious powers, obviously!\\n{NICKNAME}: Got it. Seems like you have no idea.\\n{NICKNAME}: How about we let Albedo do some research? He's good at cracking such mysteries...\\nPaimon: Please don't!",
            "About Lavender Melons\tPaimon: Lavender Melons sure are useful!\\nPaimon: Their flesh can be eaten, and their skin can be processed to make dyes.\\n{NICKNAME}: Paimon sure is useful!\\n{NICKNAME}: She can serve as my guide, and she can also give other people ugly nicknames.\\nPaimon: Yep! Thank you for your validation!\\nPaimon: Wait a minute, is there more? Is Paimon about to get roasted?\\nPaimon: Paimon's gonna cover your mouth to stop you from talking!",
            "About Swords\tPaimon: {NICKNAME}, have you noticed?\\nPaimon: In Inazuma, people who wear swords on their waists are a minority. Most soldiers use spears.\\nPaimon: Could it be that swords are a symbol of status... Should we wear them as well?\\nPaimon: But the swords here are all too big for Paimon... There's no other way, we'll have to find a famous swordsmith to make a custom one!\\n{NICKNAME}: A custom-made sword will cost a lot of Mora though.\\nPaimon: Are you saying that Mora is more important than the desires of your lovely companion?\\n{NICKNAME}: ...Actually, I've already prepared something for you, Paimon.\\nPaimon: Really? Really? Let's have a look!\\nPaimon: Hey! Isn't that the knife we use to cut fruit?\\n{NICKNAME}: Well, at least it's the right size for you...\\n{NICKNAME}: Ahem, \"What matters isn't the value of the sword, it's the fighting spirit.\"\\nPaimon: Nice try, but Paimon won't fall for this, no matter how cool it sounds!",
            "About Hot Springs\tPaimon: Did you know there are hot springs in Inazuma?\\n{NICKNAME}: ...But there are no volcanoes.\\nPaimon: Umm, Paimon heard that the heat comes from a giant furnace!\\nPaimon: If we get the chance, Paimon also wants to check out a hot spring. Unfortunately, it seems like only the big shots are granted entry.\\n{NICKNAME}: Hmmm...\\n{NICKNAME}: Let's head back to the Dadaupa Gorge in Mondstadt!\\nPaimon: Eh? Why so sudden?\\n{NICKNAME}: Back in the Dadaupa Gorge, the hilichurls have a huge cauldron that's heated by Flaming Flowers. It should be similar to a hot spring, right? You can bathe in their... soup, I guess?\\nPaimon: ???",
            "About Jugemu\tPaimon: In Inazuma, it's customary for parents to choose a lucky name for their child.\\n{NICKNAME}: Those names symbolize everyone's expectations and wishes for the child, like prosperity, wealth, good health, and safety.\\nPaimon: Because of these expectations, parents often pick extra long names, and cram all sorts of blessings into them.\\n{NICKNAME}: So hypothetically, if one day a little girl fell into a lake on her way back home, then her friends might rush to her house to tell everyone, \"Something bad happened!\"\\nPaimon: \"Oh, what happened?\"\\n{NICKNAME}: Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, Prinzessin der Verurteilung Fischl von Luftschloss Narfidort, come quick! Centennial Genius Astrologist Mona Megistus has fallen into the water!\\nPaimon: ...Mona falling into the water doesn't sound like an emergency situation though.\\n{NICKNAME}: Precisely. The fast-swimming Mona would come back home around the same time her friends are done saying her name, haha.",
            "About Inazuma's Islands\tPaimon: Inazuma's scenery is quite different than what we've seen so far.\\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah, Inazuma's an island nation.\\nPaimon: Before the invention of boats, how did the people living on different islands communicate with one another?\\n{NICKNAME}: According to Yoimiya's dad, they probably used smoke signals to transmit information.\\n{NICKNAME}: Or, they would...\\nPaimon: Yeah...?\\n{NICKNAME}: They would commission people who could freeze the water surface to travel between the islands and deliver messages.\\nPaimon: Whoa! If Kaeya had lived in Inazuma back then, he would've been even busier than Master Jean now!",
            "About Tanuki\tPaimon: Tanuki are really mysterious creatures.\\n{NICKNAME}: I think they are really cute.\\nPaimon: Yeah, they're cute... until they start talking.\\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm, I wonder... If you couldn't talk, would you appear to be more mysterious and noble?\\nPaimon: Are you trying to mock me?\\n{NICKNAME}: *randomly humming innocently*",
            "About Tanuki and Their Illusions\tPaimon: Did anyone tell you that there are monsters called tanuki in Inazuma that can take on the form of any human they see?\\n{NICKNAME}: I heard such rumors before. They must know some mysterious transformation techniques.\\nPaimon: What if one day a tanuki tricked you by transforming into Paimon? Oh no... Paimon's worried now! \\n{NICKNAME}: No worries, I'd surely be able to tell the difference— Wait! You're just concerned about my Mora, aren't you?\\nPaimon: Of course... Ah! ...No, no! Paimon's only concerned about your safety, {NICKNAME}!\\nPaimon: Hmph, stop looking at Paimon like that. *pouting* Look, just think about it! If there were two Paimons, how would you find out which one is the real one?\\n{NICKNAME}: ...Eh-he.\\nPaimon: What do you mean \"eh-he\"!?\\n{NICKNAME}: See, only the real Paimon would respond like that.\\nPaimon: Ah! Paimon got tricked again...",
            "About Other Shrines\tPaimon: We've been passing by a lot of small shrines lately, but none of them seem to be dedicated to the Electro Archon.\\n{NICKNAME}: They were probably built for lesser deities. The people of Inazuma believe that everything around them has a spirit, and those spirits will help them in their time of need.\\nPaimon: Oh, so the people make shrines for them, and give them offerings.\\n{NICKNAME}: Yeah. In a way, it's a form of prayer and a token of appreciation.\\nPaimon: Paimon gets it now! Let's find Ayaka, and have her put up a shrine for us!\\nPaimon: If we do that, we'll be able to get lots of offerings as well!\\nPaimon: Paimon's so happy!\\n{NICKNAME}: Uh... I—Is that an acceptable thing to do?\\nPaimon: What's wrong? Haven't we been helping out everyone this whole time? We may be doing an even better job than those deities!\\n{NICKNAME}: You do have a point...\\n{NICKNAME}: But when I picture people placing flowers or fruits in front of a shrine for me... it doesn't feel right.",
            "About the Rain on Yashiori Island\t{NICKNAME}: It never stops raining on Yashiori Island. I heard it's because of the lingering evil energy.\\nPaimon: \"Evil energy\"? What's that? Sounds terrifying.\\n{NICKNAME}: It's caused by the remains of an evil god somewhere on the island. Because its power hasn't fully dispersed, the remaining energy causes all sorts of misfortunes. That's what I meant when I said \"evil energy.\"\\nPaimon: Oh, that makes sense. But Paimon doesn't think rain is a bad thing.\\nPaimon: Maybe that god has been crying all this time because they were bullied.\\n{NICKNAME}: Crying? I don't think gods can cry. I mean, I've never seen Venti or Zhongli cry before.\\nPaimon: There are exceptions! If you pinch Paimon, you'll be able to see a crying god.\\n{NICKNAME}: Hmm? Are you a god?\\nPaimon: Paimon sure is!\\n{NICKNAME}: Okay, let me guess... The flying god of silly questions? The god of slimes? Or the god of being fished out from the water?\\nPaimon: Paimon's none of those! Hmph!\\nPaimon: As your bodyguard, {NICKNAME}, Paimon is the god of protection! Hehe.",
            "About Bantan Sango Detective Agency\t{NICKNAME}: In Hanamizaka, there's a place called the Bantan Sango Detective Agency.\\nPaimon: Paimon remembers. It's the one run by Sango and Ryuuji, right? Everyone speaks highly of them.\\n{NICKNAME}: Uh, I heard that they frequently get caught up in strange incidents, and some places have banned them from entering their premises...\\nPaimon: Paimon thinks that's undeserved. After all, Sango and Ryuuji have helped a lot of people...\\n{NICKNAME}: Would you invite them if you were organizing a dinner party?\\n{NICKNAME}: What if halfway through the meal, one of the guests suddenly shrieked and collapsed onto the ground...\\nPaimon: I—If that's the case, then Paimon thinks it's a bad idea. Paimon suddenly feels that hanging out with them could be dangerous...\\n{NICKNAME}: Well, that's the price you pay for being a famous detective."

It's an ancient power with unmistakable properties. Trying to harness it is dangerous indeed, I can't imagine what would happen if someone lost control of it in the city... Ah, never mind! What goes on within Mondstadt's walls is up to Mondstadt's people to deal with!",

Am I likely to get blown away?",

            "More About Venti: IV\tCelestia... I'm not sure even I could fly that far. In any case, the water there tastes foul, and the fruit is bland. You know what that means? No cider! Haha, in that case, I wouldn't go there even if I was invited.",
            "More About Venti: V\tMy greatest wish? It has always been to roam free and experience the whole world. Now, I would add that wherever I go, it simply must be with you! Each day with you is an adventure, and where adventurers go, storytellers must follow!",

            "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\tHmm... Though I've long since viewed this scenery a great many times, there is something different about seeing it again with you.

            "Character Details\tAn unknown bard that came from nowhere. He sometimes sings outdated songs, other times he hums new ones that none have ever heard of.\\nHe likes apples and lively atmospheres, but hates cheese and anything that is slimy.\\nWhen channeling Anemo, it appears in the form of out-stretched feathers, because he likes things that look light.",
            "Character Story 1\tBack when traveling bard Venti had only been in Mondstadt for a few months, his income was far less than the other more established bards in town. But once he had a few Mora in the pot from his performance, you could be sure he would hurry off to spend it at the same place every time — one of the city's taverns.\\nUnfortunately for Venti, his childlike appearance meant that his attempts to acquire alcohol failed at every turn.\\nThe first time he was refused service, he was heard grumbling: \"I'm sure there were no such preposterous regulations last time I was here...\" Once he realized that the same rule applied to all taverns in town, he decided he would have to change his approach...\\nThe strategy he developed was drinking on the job — that is to say, playing the lyre while holding a wine cup in his mouth, urging his audience to buy him a drink from the bar if they liked his performances instead of giving him Mora.\\nThe novelty of this made him quite popular in Mondstadt.\\nThere was just one snag — he couldn't help but sneeze if a cat came close...\\nAnd if he happened to be holding a wine cup in his mouth when it happened... needless to say, it would spell disaster.\\nVenti, therefore, has one golden rule when selecting a spot to perform, and that is that there must be no cats in the vicinity.\\nEasier said than done — the stray cats of Mondstadt seem to be quite drawn to him.",
            "Character Story 2\tThere is a towering oak tree at the center of Windrise, said to have sprouted when Vennessa ascended to the heavens a millennium ago.\\nIn the past few months, travelers resting in the shade of the great oak sometimes hear a young boy singing the tales of Barbatos, the Anemo Archon.\\nUnlike the ruling deities of the other nations, Barbatos has long left Mondstadt. In fact, the only visible proof of his connection with Mondstadt is the Statues of The Seven that appear across the land — even then, the resemblance is vague at best. Fortunately, Barbatos's past deeds are recorded in books and epics, sung and passed on by the bards.\\nIn contrast to these more canonical works, Venti's ballads tend to include bizarre adventures and acts of mischief, such as the time that Barbatos pinched the Cryo Archon's scepter and replaced it with a hilichurl's wooden club...\\nWorshippers of Barbatos are quick to decry these frivolous tales as blasphemous fabrications. But whenever someone confronts Venti about this, his response suggests that he has not an ounce of remorse.\\n\"How can you know that they're fabrications?\"\\nHe has a point — even the most devoted sister could not possibly know the details of all Barbatos's deeds from a millennium ago.\\nOnly Venti knows the truth behind his song lyrics, and it is a truth he hides behind an enigmatic smile.\\nReason being, yes — Venti's tall tales of Barbatos's unorthodox exploits are entirely fabricated.\\nHey, Venti finds that a few drinks really gets his muse going. Can you really blame him?",
            "Character Story 3\tAround 2,600 years ago, the Archon War had yet to end, and the world had yet to fall under the dominion of The Seven.\\nIn those days, the city called \"Mondstadt\" was surrounded on all sides by gales impenetrable even to the birds of the air. Their ceaseless howling ground the soil and the rock of that city into smooth, flowing dust.\\nThe Lord of Wind who lived in his high tower was Decarabian, God of Storms. He squinted from on high at his subjects, who bowed before him in the unceasing wind, and, believing them submissive, thought this good.\\nIn those days, Venti was but a single thread of the thousand winds that roared through the northern lands.\\nHe who would in latter days be known as \"Barbatos\" was but a tiny elemental spirit, without a shred of divine dignity, a breeze that brought subtle changes for the better, or tiny seeds of hope.\\nIn Mondstadt of old, Venti met a young boy. This lad knew how to play the lyre, and longed to write the greatest poem of all.\\n\"I do so wish to see the birds in flight.\"\\nSo said the boy who had never seen the blue sky, eagles, or the green grass, his voice almost utterly drowned by the wind.\\n\"Friend, will you not come along?\"",
            "Character Story 4\tThe elemental being Venti obtained the feather of an eagle for the lad living in that storm-shrouded city, who had never seen a bird in his life.\\nThen, war broke out in Mondstadt, in the name of freedom.\\nWith the feather tucked away in his breast pocket, Venti watched the fall of the eccentric ruler amid the wrack and ruin of revolt together with his friend.\\nThe ruler had believed that he had given his subjects a city free from the bitter cold, and to the end, he believed that they had loved him as he loved them.\\nYet, despite the victory, Venti was never able to give that feather to the lad, for that lad had fallen in the battle for the sake of song, sky, and birds, and for the people who, like him, had dwelled within the storm-wall.\\nWith the crumbling of an ancient seat of divinity, a new god was born. The Anemo Archon Barbatos felt power flowing at his fingertips.\\nHis first use of this power was to reconstitute himself in the likeness of that young lad.\\nFor only if he wore human shape could he play the lyre that the lad so loved.\\nPlucking its strings, he scattered the ice and snow and split the mountains with a divine wind.\\nHe bade Mondstadt become a city of freedom, a nation without a king.\\nIn future, he believed, it would become a better, more romantic city.\\n\"Surely, he too would have wanted to live in such a place.\"\\nThus, a new age began for Mondstadt.",
            "Character Story 5\tThe Anemo Archon cannot take credit for everything in Mondstadt.\\nCredit should be given where credit is due, I shall sing now the praises of things beauteous and true:\\nWe thank the West Wind, whose enduring caress\\nBrings the blossoms of Spring, by whose scent we are blessed.\\n\\nFinches, ducks, rabbits and boars,\\nMondstadt's revival bid them thrive evermore.\\nIn summer the lion walks the plains,\\nNo words one finds to praise it but these:\\nDo you sweat out your water to make way for wine?\\nComes the heat of the summer from your mane of sunshine?\\n\\nThe mountain mouths and gorges low like drunkards wayward lie...\\nBut the East Wind cares not, for it doesn't walk — it flies!\\nOver the fruit trees it brushes low,\\nAnd its wings bring the harvest of things that grow.\\n\\nThe North Wind in the silent forest slumbers,\\nAnd around it pace the wolves in their numbers.\\nThough most have never a glimpse of them seen, for the Wind knows that none is of winter too keen,\\nYet the Anemo Archon glimpses and sees, that it dreams each night of warm reverie.\\n\\n—As the four seasons in turn shall say their piece, so the four winds too shall never cease.\\nOf course, to look at it differently, I am the one who should be credited here, and not they.\\nCredits should be given where credits belong — if not for the bard who pens the song, then who shall ensure that these tales are passed on?",
            "Where the Wind Doth Not Blow\tAfter 1,600 years of history, Mondstadt's \"freedom\" had sunk to a heretofore unseen low.\\nBarbatos, unwilling to become a tyrant, had departed. But he had never imagined that those to whom he had gifted freedom would make for themselves a tyrant.\\nThe aristocracy ruled Mondstadt with a cruel hand, bringing slaves into this land and ignoring the cries of the oppressed.\\nThus the Anemo Archon returned after these 1,600 years to what was once the City of Freedom. He heard the cry of the slave girl Vennessa, and together with her raised a rebellion that overthrew the aristocracy.\\n—Now, the above is what all know to be the official history of Mondstadt.\\nThe story has an interesting, little-known twist, however.\\nThe one who united the people of Mondstadt in this conflict was indeed the hero Vennessa — but that which caused many of the aristocracy's troops to turn coat was a \"treachery against the wind.\"\\nA secret treaty was found, a betrayal of the city — the aristocrats had forsaken the wind, and sold everything in Mondstadt to the Geo Archon of the neighboring land.\\nAt the treaty's end was carved an insignia inimitable by all save the deity so named: Rex Lapis.\\nHow the soldiers that had once oppressed the slaves shuddered when they saw that they too would become slaves in a foreign land.\\nThe news, and the conflict, spread like wildfire, consuming the aristocracy. It was only many years later that historians would discover that this treaty was fake.\\nAs it turned out, Venti had once practiced the art of forgery in order to play pranks on the Geo Archon, but could never deceive the god of wealth and transactions. Even so, his adeptness would come into play after several hundred years.\\nWhat a happy coincidence.",
            "Vision\tThe Seven Archons do not need Visions, for they already have great power.\\nYet Barbatos was fond of the mortal world, and wanted to roam Mondstadt more freely as \"Venti.\" As such, he constructed a glass ornament very much like the Visions worn by those chosen by the gods.\\nThe imitation has no special abilities, nor does Venti rely on it to channel elemental power.\\nHowever, since Venti does not keep the Holy Lyre der Himmel by his side, and since he is too lazy to bring a normal lyre, he gave his fake Vision the ability to turn into the wooden lyre \"Der Frühling.\""

I can make whatever you want, even if it's not on the menu!\"\\nThe workers at Wanmin Restaurant can recognize a regular, if not by their face, then by the first sentence out of their mouths.\\nA customer that orders without needing a menu has been at least a few times before. However, if they ask \"Is Xiangling the chef today?\" then they're definitely a regular.",
            "Character Story 1\tXiangling has destroyed many a wok in her time. Either the insides would become irreversibly charred from the heat of a Pyro Slime, or cracks would appear due to flash-freezing from a Mist Flower — or, at some step in Xiangling's unconventional cooking process, a small-scale explosion would reduce it to scrap metal. After some heavy consideration on the part of Xiangling's father, he ultimately decided not to banish his daughter from the kitchen, despite the destruction she caused.\\nAs reckless, imaginative, and uninhibited as she may be, it was exactly these traits that led her to create her most successful dishes. \"Maybe this isn't so bad...\" He tried to convince himself.\\nSuffice to say that payment for a new wok is a regular feature of the restaurant's monthly ledger.",
            "Character Story 2\t\"There are many secrets to cooking; the most important of which is passion.\"\\nWhen Xiangling decided to learn to be a chef, her father handed her his own handwritten cooking journal, his life's work. That line was written on the title page.\\nIf she was any other person, she would likely have regarded it as some cheesy inspirational quote. However, Xiangling regarded it as a priceless treasure.\\nTo her, her father only secured his footing in the forever-ongoing war between the Li and Yue cuisines by upholding that principle.\\nHowever, at that time, the conflict between the two styles was white-hot, with many restaurants feeling the pressure that arose from it. Wanmin Restaurant was no exception.\\n\"Good food is good food, period!\"\\nThe monopoly on luxurious ingredients such as matsutake and crabs infuriated Xiangling, her angry response to which was to take over in the kitchen.\\nIt was time for her to build upon the foundation her father gave her and make some changes.\\n\"I'm gonna make super-delicious dishes out of any ingredient!\"",

They one day awoke to find their fighting clubs gone.\\nOf course, the flora in Dihua Marsh did not fare any better.\\nAfter all the work she put in, she finally created some new recipes, such as Hilichurl Club BBQ Fish and Horsetail Sticky Rice and Meat...\\nShe'd never create anything new if she just stuck to the recipes of her predecessors.\\nOne must break with common conception if they are to carve their own path.\\nWhen Xiangling finally created her crowning achievement, the Chef's Special Cold-Dressed Fowl, her father paid the price, needing to resort to simple white congee for two days following.\\n\"Mint and Qingxin Flower seem to induce diarrhea...\"\\nShe learned a valuable experience to add to her journal.\\nStrange. She ate her own dishes, but nothing ever happened to her. Xiangling did feel guilty though.\\nMaybe it was because she was young and healthy, or had somehow built up a resistance to certain toxins... One may never know.",

Halfway there, she was already tired and hungry. She stumbled into a cave, and came across a strange shrine.\\nSo she sat down by the shrine, and took out two pieces of spicy cornbread.\\nShe gobbled down one, but left the other one on the shrine, intending to eat a little later, but then promptly fell asleep.\\nWhen she woke up, the other spicy cornbread was gone and a mysterious creature was sitting in front of her, staring.\\n\"Was it good?\"\\nIt nodded.\\n\"More?\" She took out some jerky from her backpack.\\nThe mysterious creature nodded once again.\\nThis was how Xiangling made a new friend. It seemed to be drawn to Xiangling's cooking, as the creature started following Xiangling around wherever she went.\\nXiangling named it \"Guoba,\" after her favorite childhood snack.",
            "Character Story 5\tAfter sampling every dish there was in Liyue, Xiangling's culinary skills drastically improved. Her specialty spicy dishes earned the praise of even her father, a veteran chef with over two decades of experience.\\nShe created her unique and complex flavor profile through a generous helping of chili peppers mixed with fruits and herbs for increased aroma. She also created what became the signature dish of Wanmin Restaurant: Black-Back Perch Stew, which combines the richness, color and strong flavors of Li cuisine with the fresh aromas and nutritional content of Yue cuisine.\\nSome have tried to copy her recipes, but try as they might they can never quite reproduce the way her cooking tastes.\\n\"Braise fresh Violetgrass overnight. Dry, then grind to a fine powder. Sprinkle into any dish for an aromatic boost.\"\\nThis is one of Xiangling's secret recipes, arrived at through a painstaking process of trial and error.\\nIn Xiangling's case, that means countless bouts of diarrhea, countless bruised knees bashed on rocky cliffs, and countless wasted potfuls of food that didn't quite turn out as expected.",
            "Xiangling's Map\tThis map of Teyvat is lined with dense notations in various colors, and if you read closely, you can find the places where Xiangling has been, and where she intends to go in future.\\n\"The shellfish of the shallows around Guyun Stone Forest are unmatched in their freshness. They say that 'here be sea monsters'?\"\\n\"Sea monster meat tastes great. Should look for Beidou to go fight another one. Will steaming them with eggs make them taste better?\"\\n\"There's a dragon in Mondstadt? Great! I just need three days of provisions to get there.\"\\n\"Valberries are sweet. Lots here. I'll bring a basket. Take some back. See if they'll grow.\"\\n\"This Mondstadt restaurant's Sautéed Matsutake is way too luxurious! They should just sell the matsutake.

            "Vision\t\"You can make something super delicious out of any kind of ingredient.\"\\nXiangling earned the approval of a Vision by shouldering this ideal in a wholehearted and unreserved manner. Even when she would make dishes that could be called \"horrifying,\" her desire to keep trying to match ingredients would never waver.\\n\"Ugh... Qingxin Fried Lizard is actually kinda bad. I think lizards should just be stone-grilled in future.\"\\n\"Slime fried rice is also rather ordinary. Maybe we'll try putting mushrooms in a slime jus next time.\"\\nThough her friends fell around her during the epic battles with the taste of her dishes and advised her to turn back, Xiangling never stopped thinking about how to turn these \"special\" ingredients into delicious food.\\nIn Xiangling's innocent and persistent heart, as long as they were not poisonous, there were no good or bad ingredients.\\nHer Vision, after all, proves that even the gods approve of such thinking."

He is highly dangerous, and has the most piercing gaze you've ever seen.\\nHe enjoys a formidable reputation and high level of seniority among the adepti, but is relatively unknown in the mortal realm.\\nThis is inevitable. Xiao is not one of those popular deities to whom people pray for wealth and protection, nor is he a mystical sage of Jueyun Karst to whom pilgrims flock in search of divine wisdom.\\nNo... If any mortal witnesses Xiao unleashing his true power, it is certain to be under the direst of circumstances — and they will be extremely lucky if they survive the ordeal.\\nThis is not because Xiao seeks to harm people. Rather, since Xiao wages a constant war against dark forces powerful enough to devour Liyue in its entirety, any bystanders who witness him in the heat of battle are likely to end up as collateral damage.\\nNot that this is a secret worth going around silencing witnesses for.",
            "Character Story 1\tWhat exactly is Xiao wrestling with?\\nThe tactful answer would be old grudges, unfulfilled dreams, the lamentations of the vanquished...\\nThe unmitigated truth is that Xiao fights against the remnants of the defeated gods from the Archon War, which took place prior to the rise of The Seven.\\nMorax defeated those gods and buried their remains beneath the rocks of the earth.\\nHowever, gods are immortal. Their consciousness may diminish, but their power and hatred will always remain and spread like poison, relentlessly stirring up chaos for the world and its inhabitants.\\nLiyue's rulers, who are aware of the truth regarding Xiao, refer to him in his millennia-long experience as the \"Bane of All Evil.\" \\nThe war he fights can never be won, and will never come to an end.\\nIt is also an invisible war that no one will ever witness or thank him for.",
            "Character Story 2\tXiao is not this yaksha's true name, but a name given to him in the interests of his own protection.\\nBack in a younger, more naive time, a god had gotten a hold of Xiao's weakness and forced him to serve as their bloodhound, in which capacity he was forced to perform cruel and violent acts.\\nMany died at his hand, many hopes were crushed, and he was even forced into devouring his victims' dreams. As much as it pained him to do this, he was helpless to resist.\\nFinally, on the battlefield of the Archon War, Morax, the Geo Archon, had a fateful encounter with the yaksha's master.\\nThe current state of the world has already revealed the results of that battle.\\nRex Lapis liberated the yaksha and gave him the name \"Xiao.\" \\n\"In the fables of another world, the name Xiao is that of a spirit who encountered great suffering and hardship. He endured much suffering, as you have. Use this name from now on.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tTo repay his debt of gratitude to the Geo Archon, Xiao shouldered the burden of protecting Liyue in the millennia that followed.\\nHis past of service under the evil god had rid Xiao of his innocence and gentleness. All that remained within him was the means to kill and the weight of his sins.\\nThe only way he could be of service to mortals was in doing battle.\\nBut what could people do for him in return?\\nNo ordinary person would ever stop to ask such a question. The sight of Xiao, even far off in the distance, was intimidating enough to send people instantly running for their lives.\\nThat said... if ever someone did want to show some appreciation for Xiao, there is perhaps one thing they could try.\\nThere is a certain secret agent of the Qixing who is tasked with supporting Xiao in subduing demons. That secret agent runs a front organization called the Wangshu Inn.\\nOccasionally, Xiao stops by the inn for a bowl of Almond Tofu, and if you could see the look on his face when he eats it... there's no mistaking it — he clearly loves the stuff.\\nNonetheless, it is not the sweet taste that Xiao hankers after. It's the texture he finds irresistible — apparently, it's very similar to that of the dreams he used to devour.",
            "Character Story 4\tWhat exactly is Xiao wrestling with?\\nTo those in Liyue's corridors of power, Xiao's battle is against the evil manifestations produced by the remnants of defeated gods.\\nHowever, if you asked Xiao the same question, he may well give you an entirely different answer.\\nXiao was once enslaved by an evil god and suffered immensely under his rule until finally regaining his freedom at Rex Lapis' hand.\\nXiao's powers were highly regarded by the adepti and he seemed to vanquish all manner of evil demons with consummate ease.\\nBut the evil gods also held immense power, and their lust for revenge ran deeper than mere mortals could ever contemplate. Xiao relentlessly slaughtered the endless, impure manifestations of their vengeful souls, but in doing so, he caused them to fracture. Eventually, these fragments of their hatred were able to taint Xiao's own soul.\\nThe only way to eradicate such hatred is to accept the karmic debt it brings. The magnitude of the bad karma Xiao has accumulated over the years is enough to consume flesh, bone, and soul alike.\\nAnd yet, Xiao does not feel any hatred. Having lived for over two thousand years, no single karmic debt constitutes anything more than a fleeting memory.\\nNo grudge can last a thousand years, nor is any debt so great that it cannot be paid off in this time.\\nXiao has spent many long years alone.\\nBut his battles have never been in vain.\\nBecause ultimately, the one with whom Xiao wrestles is himself.",
            "Character Story 5\tWhat does Xiao fight against?\\nThe Traveler understands very well that Xiao fights against the darkness that threatens Liyue. He fights to defend Liyue.\\nBut who will defend him?\\nThere was once when most of Xiao's strength was spent fighting from dusk till dawn, with him emerging victorious by a mere hair.\\nThe reeds in the fields had been sliced to ribbons in the fierce fighting. Plucking his spear from where it had been planted in the ground, Xiao began the trek home.\\nWell, one says \"home\" — yet, where did Xiao have to return to? He was merely leaving the battlefield.\\nLong exhausted, Xiao felt the divine hatred that tainted his body take effect.\\nLimitless hate flooded his senses, and he fell to the ground in agony.\\nBut it was also at that moment that the pain vanished without warning.\\nThis was not by Xiao's own strength, for he had been rescued by the sound of a flute.\\nThe clear, lovely sound of the flute came over the mountains and rivers, carried on the wind to where he lay.\\nAnd clear it continued to ring till the first light of dawn brought with it the startled flight of distant birds.\\nIt protected Xiao, massaging his wild senses, and giving him a moment's peace.\\nWho was playing this music?

As such, they wandered the land in a state of unending suffering.\\nThe chapter lists many methods of comforting the yaksha, such as food offerings, holy chants, and the like. These would appease the yaksha and help them to continue defending the peace.\\nAs noble warriors among adepti, the yaksha would often descend upon the battlefield in person. However, as conflicts grew over the millennia, they have almost been wiped out. Today, large statues of the yaksha subduing demons remain within Liyue's borders, but they have had their features destroyed.\\nBy the by, the language used in that text was so meandering, and its contents so dense, that it sold far fewer copies than the Teyvat Travel Guide and the international cultural summaries written by El Musk.",
            "Vision\tAll adepti are known as the \"mighty and illuminated\" adepti, and this \"illumination\" refers to the light of a third \"eye\" that they possess: a Vision.\\nBut do adepti receive their Visions as a form of acknowledgment from Celestia, like humans do?\\nXiao no longer remembers the moment he received his Vision. To humans, this would be an unforgettable event. But for him, this was just the beginning of his endless battle.\\nThe thing that Xiao truly cannot forget is something different.\\nThere are a great many human festivals, and few remember the stories behind them.\\nThe greater part of these days coincide with occasions where man-eating monsters were defeated by the adepti host. People imitated their deeds and staged exorcism rituals to remember their ancient heroism, with these practices eventually evolving into celebratory festivals.\\nThe hatred and residual might of many of the gods defeated by Morax throughout Liyue will sometimes erupt with abnormal force amid their half-awake, half-dreaming state. Among them, the eruption that takes place during the Lantern Rite is the most extreme in scale.\\nXiao has his mission to perform the time-honored \"Nuo Dance of Evil Conquering,\" and so he fights night and day during the Lantern Rite. Thus, he has come to hate it.\\nNow, Xiao did not consider battle dangerous. It was due to his hard work that Liyue was kept safe. People lit their lanterns, and the blessed lights shone across the night sky and the nearshore.\\nAt that moment, another special feeling blossomed in Xiao's heart. Loneliness? Peace? Or was it his fears for the future? The young-seeming adeptus searched his heart, only to find no answers."

            "Character Details\tEvery merchant in Liyue Harbor knows of Xingqiu from the Feiyun Commerce Guild.\\nAll see him as a kind and well-mannered young man who is an excellent student, a top talent in every sense.\\nAs the second-born son of the family, Xingqiu is not required to shoulder the burden of managing the Guild's affairs. However, Xingqiu possesses a unique scholarly talent among his peers — that is, the offspring of Liyue's wealthiest merchants — and was often praised by his tutors as a young student.\\nXingqiu's elder brother, while he was learning the family business from their father, firmly believed that Xingqiu would become a great asset to the business one day.\\nHowever, little did he know that Xingqiu, after finishing the dauntingly thick volumes on commerce and philosophy, would hollow them out and sneak martial art novels into them, which he read incessantly thereafter.\\nSometimes, Xingqiu suddenly disappears for hours at a time with no explanation. When asked why, he simply replies: \"A moment of solitude.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tTo Xingqiu, \"a moment of solitude\" can mean all sorts of things.\\nExamples include visiting Wanwen Bookhouse to peruse the latest novels and going to Heyu Tea House to sample Yunjin's latest drink.\\nSometimes, it means that he is off to fight for justice in the name of chivalry.\\nDefeating bandits on the road, driving away monsters, helping distressed children by fetching their kites from the tree tops... there are all manner of responsibilities that fall into the category of chivalry.\\nInspired by tropes from his beloved martial arts novels — such as the king who wears a disguise and mingles with the common folk — Xingqiu does not hesitate to leverage the power of the Feiyun Commerce Guild to resolve more complex issues when violence isn't the answer.",
            "Character Story 2\tOne day, Xingqiu's older brother came looking for him, only to find he wasn't around. When Xingqiu later returned, he came across his brother in the hallway.\\n\"Your room was a mess, so I cleaned it up. Listen, both you and I are responsible for the reputation of Feiyun Commerce Guild. We have to act the part. If you can't clean up a room, how will you clean up the world? An adeptus once said...\"\\nAfter half an hour of lecturing, Xingqiu was finally let go, but his brother said something strange at the end:\\n\"I'll not enter your room without permission next time... I'll make sure the maids do the same.\"\\nXingqiu had no idea what he was talking about. However, as his brother turned away, with a despondent look upon his face, he muttered to himself:\\n\"Those books under his bed... No. No, I shouldn't go looking at what kind of books they are... Xingqiu is growing up after all... Don't want to be lecturing him all the time... Puberty perhaps?\"\\nAfterwards, even Xingqiu found it odd. Expecting that one of the maids would have something to say about the stash of martial arts novels under his bed, he had long since prepared his response, but in the end, no one ever bothered to check his room again.",
            "Character Story 3\tTo keep Xingqiu from spending his whole day at Wanwen Bookhouse in Feiyun Slope, his father agreed to let him learn martial arts from the Guhua Clan. Much to his dismay, Xingqiu quickly discovered that Guhua was a dying art that had been in constant decline for years. There was no proper tuition and it turned out the luxury dojo he had signed up in didn't even belong to the clan — they had just rented it temporarily to keep up appearances.\\nXingqiu's father was, of course, fully aware of this state of affairs in advance. To him, the whole thing was just for fun; he thought Xingqiu would be content to learn a spot of bladework for show, not for serious self-defense.\\nHe hadn't counted on the prodigiously intelligent and extremely well-read Xingqiu being as outstanding a talent in Guhua as he was in every other discipline he had turned his hand to. A combination of his own intuition and extensive knowledge of ancient literature meant he was able to completely revitalize the dead art.\\nXingqiu was disappointed by Guhua's martial arts program at the beginning, but he found the other tricks they taught to be exactly what he had hoped for.\\nQuicklime, smoking sand, paper fish, sword-swallowing, fire-breathing... Xingqiu was spoilt for choice.\\nHe decided on the spot that he would learn them all, no matter how long it would take him. He reasoned that they would be useful to have in his repertoire during his future exploits as a chivalrous hero.",
            "Character Story 4\tThere are two sides to the swashbuckling Xingqiu's personality. While quiet and unassuming in front of strangers, he is gregarious and chatty in the company of close friends and family. Though more restrained than his elder brother, he even has a playful and mischievous side.\\nThe one who usually bears the brunt of his bizarre sense of humor is someone named Chongyun, an exorcist usually found on one of the forest trails around Liyue.\\n\"Chongyun... I found a haunted house for you to practice in...\"\\n\"Chongyun, you have to believe me... It wasn't me who laid the traps inside that haunted house— What? It's not haunted? Well... I, uh, couldn't have known that, could I?\"\\n\"Chongyun... Don't glare at me like that... Look, you're injured. You'd better just lie there and get some rest.\"\\n\"Tell you what, Chongyun, we have a maid who learned the art of essential oil therapy in a nobleman's house in Sumeru... How about I ask her to tend to your wounds? You owe me for this, though...\"",
            "Character Story 5\tThe notion of chivalry means different things to different people.\\nChivalry means listening to your conscience calling you to action when you see an injustice, right? Or is chivalry simply about knowing right from wrong? No, that's not enough — it must have something to do with being a righteous person...\\nTo Xingqiu, chivalry simply means: Be good, and do good.\\nAs a son of a wealthy merchant in Liyue Harbor, he was born to ride the waves in the world of trade. Notions of chivalry should have gradually left him as he grew up.\\nHowever, obtaining a Vision changed everything — it meant he was finally able accomplish those legendary deeds he could only dream of as a child.\\nOf course, there is no way he can completely divest himself of his duties in the Guild, but so long as he gets to go out and be the hero even occasionally, he is perfectly content with his life.\\nThe only thing that can wipe the smile from Xingqiu's face is when cynics question the true motives of chivalrous heroes.\\nRank, reputation, reward, shadowy deals... Whenever Xingqiu hears people smearing the names of true heroes, the expression on his face may not change, but he will be sure to add that person to the special section of his blacklist reserved for people he despises even more than carrots.",
            "\"A Legend of Sword\"\tXingqiu once wrote a martial arts novel named \"A Legend of Sword\" based on his own experiences, intending to publish it in Liyue Harbor.\\nTo his surprise, his manuscript was rejected by local publishing houses, who believed that no one would have any interest in a story with \"a setting as wildly unrealistic as the plot is banal.\"\\nUndeterred, Xingqiu had a few copies printed privately, and sneakily placed them on the shelves of Wanwen Bookhouse during one of his many trips there. But just as the publishers had suspected, it failed to garner much interest from readers. This was quite a blow to Xingqiu's confidence.\\nUnbeknownst to him, however, a passing merchant from Inazuma did purchase a copy to bring home, where it received rave reviews. Writers the region over attempted to copy the success of \"A Legend of Sword,\" but none succeeded — it maintains permanent residency in the number one bestseller spot to this day.",
            "Vision\tThe martial arts school known as the Guhua Clan has been in decline for several hundred years now. In its heyday, the name of the Clan rang like steel throughout the harbor. It was said that the Clan harbored three great secret arts — the ways of the \"Light Piercer\" for polearms, \"Rain Cutter\" for swords, and \"Life Ender\" for those who excelled in both. The three arts would be refined over the generations, and with time would reach their apex. Yet the Clan's strength would continue to wane, leading to them losing their influence... The three arts became diamonds hidden in the rough, quietly awaiting a successor.\\nAfter many years, the Guhua Clan would finally get one in Xingqiu. It was he who successfully grasped the ancient \"Martial Principle\" after merely four years of study.\\nThe Guhua weapon arts stress using the weapon as an extension of your body, and indeed this is a common idea amongst the various schools of martial arts in Liyue. But the way Xingqiu saw it, the basis of the polearm and sword was the use of a Vision. Martial artists were meant to see a Vision as an extension of themselves, and see their weapon as an extension of the Vision. Hence, he says that: the arts of both the polearm and the sword are just the art of the \"eye.\" \\nHaving come to this epiphany, Xingqiu took up a quill and penned a verse on the Martial Principle. Reading it, the Guhua head was shaken with tears, declaring that \"it is not Xingqiu who needs the Guhua Clan, but the Guhua Clan that needs Xingqiu.\" Since then, this verse has been sealed up at the Clan headquarters at Wangshan Hall. Disciples are proscribed from reading it, much less outsiders.\\nThe verse reads thus:\\nGuhua's arts I have studied long, in its secrets I am trained, now its long-lost depths fall upon me like the coming of blessed rain.\\nThe beating heart of Guhua's sword art is as a shower of floating flowers. One amidst may seize a bloom, but those without read only doom.\\nThe Guhua lance is a lantern's dance, like flames in night's deep glooming. Like sparks, they scatter with ease in the dark, then join like the daybreak looming.\\nThey say the sword is as your arm — I say its glint is the beholder's eye, a light like the bright dawn coming.\\nThose who wander are burdened not. Freely they cut rain, and enlightened they pierce light. Like a snaking dragon, they cannot be subdued. In their right eye the blade, and in the other the spear.\\nThis text should have been free for all to read. The only reason why it was sealed is the dreadful handwriting."

I was touched, let me tell you what. Like, hey, someone gets it! I agreed right away... But when I got there, I found out that he was the consultant at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. What a weird guy. I mean, how was that appropriate?",
            "About Ningguang\tY'know, the Millelith used to get in my way all the time. Can't set up a stage here, can't perform there. Real bother, it was... Ahem. But after I wrote to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, I heard that the Tianquan amended one of Liyue's... Uh, some rule or something. She designated some spots for performances to take place, so long as you apply. *sigh* It's still a load of trouble if you ask me, but it's better than being harangued by those Millelith every time, so...",
            "About Baizhu\tDr. Baizhu's prescriptions are the tops at preserving my voice. I did an impromptu performance for him as thanks, but... the snake he keeps around his neck fainted away. Haha, now it ducks up Dr. Baizhu's sleeve every time I'm around. I only discovered afterwards that snakes are very sensitive to vibrations.",
            "About Beidou\tHer? She speaks her mind and has a big heart, and we get on great. The Crux's adventures are real epic. They've given me tons of inspiration in the past! I even wrote them a song. Nowadays, I just need to sing the first line, and most all the sailors will join in. It's fast becoming a new sea shanty, it is.",
            "About Chongyun\tHe's one interesting guy. He looks introverted enough, but there was this one time when he came to one of my performances. A friend brought him or something, and he had some words for me, but I couldn't hear 'em over the music. Before I knew it, he was right up there on the stage with me, singing and rockin' his heart out. Guess you really can't judge a book by its cover!",
            "About Hu Tao\tI've no clue what she's thinking, going around looking all happy-clappy like that when she's the head of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Always greets me cheerily too, saying \"I like people who play with fire, they're good for business\" or somethin' like that... She's a bit bizarre, I tell you.",
            "About Yunjin\tTell you a secret — but you gotta keep it that way, you hear? She's real fond of rock 'n' roll. Comes to watch me at least three times a week no matter how packed her schedule is. You'd think that the head of Heyu Tea House's troupe would be into finer arts and all, eh? But I guess it gets suffocating after a while. Haha.",
            "More About Xinyan: I\tYou wanna know more about me? Haha! Well, aren't you just odd? Most people would do just the opposite. Well, where should we start? ...Eh, I guess we'll start with rock 'n' roll.",
            "More About Xinyan: II\tBack when I was little, the adults all said I had to be more girly, that I should learn and study all these things. Wasn't ever any good at it, though, and I'd often get roasted bad. Rock 'n' roll's a different story. No one ever taught me, but I can do it just fine. And of course, the adults say \"that's unladylike!\" *sigh* Talk about prejudice.",
            "More About Xinyan: III\tSay, do you notice anything different 'bout me today? I did some facial massages to relax my mouth and eyes, and practiced smiling less broadly in front of a mirror for half an hour. So, how'd it go? Do I look a bit less fierce than usual? ...Even scarier? Huh, okay...",
            "More About Xinyan: IV\tThanks for staying to jam with me! It's almost time for lunch. I've brought your share as well! We've got tomatoes, sausages, fried eggs... Say what? I don't seem like the type? H—Hey now, don't you look down on me. M—Making a nice-looking meal was no problem at all!",
            "More About Xinyan: V\tI believe in rock 'n' roll's spirit of resistance, but I don't think it means that I have to go around shoving it in people's faces. I'm perfectly capable of living normally. I can sew, I can grow flowers and keep fish, and make nice-looking meals. I'm allowed to like anything... or anyone I want, right?",
            "Xinyan's Hobbies\tHobbies? Rock 'n' roll, of course! You ever have that something you put your all into? When everything you love comes together into one thing, the place and time loses all importance. You just need to enjoy it to the fullest, and express yourself to your heart's content! Haha... Ah, I can never get enough of that feeling.",
            "Xinyan's Troubles\t*sigh* I send children a-crying every time I accidentally lock eyes with them on the road. *sigh* If only there was a way to make me look a little less scary. But I've tried everythin', and nothing sticks...",
            "Favorite Food\tThe lunch down at the Liyue dockyards rocks! Ahh, oily, meaty... Bit skimpy on the vegetables, but I could never get tired of it! Far as I'm concerned, a whole day in the dockyards is worth it just for the lunch!",
            "Least Favorite Food\tNot that I'm picky, but I can't stand bland food. If it's supposed to be salty or spicy, make it salty or spicy! You can't have a good time if you don't go all-in on the flavor! Even if all I had on hand were enough ingredients for one serving of Jewelry Soup, I'd make sure I'd do right by them!",
            "Birthday\tHappy birthday! I made some embroidery especially for you. Check it out — I sewed both our images on in the style of Fontaine's dolls. Pretty cute, eh? ...Why are you looking at me like that? Wh—What, it's not that weird that I can do embroidery!",

        "story": [
            "Character Details\tRock 'n' roll originates in Fontaine and is just starting to find its feet in Liyue Harbor, where Xinyan is pioneering the art.\\nEvery night, she slings on her self-built instrument, steps onto her self-constructed stage, and plays her self-composed songs to a crowd of enthusiastic supporters.\\nHer music reflects her personality: bold and defiant, loud and proud.\\nShe is no virtuoso, but this doesn't bother her dedicated fans one bit as they let loose and enjoy the show, singing their hearts out and shaking off the stress of the day.\\nIn the heat of the moment, the fire that leaps from Xinyan's Vision seems ready to turn night into day.\\n\"She is a rare rock 'n' roll talent and a master performer who really knows how to create an atmosphere,\" said a review of one of her live shows in The Steambird.\\nLiving in Liyue is expensive, especially when you want to enjoy the finer things in life. But as Xinyan would say to those tied down by worldly worries:\\n\"If you know how to rock, then it's easier to roll.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tXinyan does not adhere to traditional performance norms at all. Anything can be used as her instrument.\\nThe pillars on-stage, the floorboards, the cheers and yells of the audience, and even the explosions and sparks created by her Vision are valid brushes with which she paints her performance.\\nThe impromptu stage often starts to burn somewhere after the halfway mark of the performance, till all that's left is a smoking pile of charcoal.\\nAfter many warnings, the Millelith were finally forced to tighten their patrols and try to find ways to stop Xinyan from staging her performances.\\nThe subsequent battles of wits tended to turn out in Xinyan's favor — she was often able to find a place to perform, set up a stage with frightening speed, and begin a raucous night with her audience.\\nThe more reliable word on the street is that many patrolling Millelith were themselves infected by the \"spirit of rock 'n' roll,\" becoming her loyal fans in the process.\\nXinyan would get wind of the Millelith's latest patrol plans from these \"friends of rock,\" and was thus able to avoid their eyes with ease.\\nEventually, tiring of the lack of results, and in the absence of any evidence that anyone was harmed during Xinyan's performances, the Millelith came to adopt a \"one eye open, one eye shut\" approach to her actions.",
            "Character Story 2\tXinyan is tall, has a sharp gaze, and always wears her stage costume in public to keep herself in the right mood for her music.\\nIn the eyes of bystanders, this makes her quite the imposing sight as she walks down the street, and many assume she means trouble.\\nWhen she lines up to buy a snack, people in front of her in the queue will panic and move well out of her way.\\nIf she happens to lock eyes with a young child, even for a brief moment, they will run crying to their parents.\\nEven when she has done nothing at all, Xinyan is often suspected of wrongdoing, purely because her fierce appearance makes her look like some sort of heinous villain in the eyes of some people.\\nXinyan didn't care all that much about how other people saw her, but she did think that it wasn't a good thing to scare others and make trouble for them, if she could at all help it. Thus, she constantly looked for ways to make a change.\\nEvery day when she woke up in the morning, she would look at herself in the mirror and massage her face with her fingers to stretch and relax her eyes a little.\\nShe would even practice smiling and study expressions — verbal and facial alike — of great elegance.\\nAfter a significant amount of practice, she once came across a group of children bullying another child, and instinctually she went over to rescue the bullied child.\\nShe gave the kid what she thought was a friendly smile and a gentle pat on the head. To say that the upset child quietened down after this would not be incorrect...\\nHowever, the reality of the matter was that the child was stood there frozen in fear as urine dribbled down their pants.\\nAs for the would-be bullies, they screamed and fled in panic.\\n\"Run! Run! The angry lady's turned into a monster! Sh—She's gonna eat us all!\"\\n\"Hey!!! I ain't gonna eat y'all! ...And I ain't no monster, either!\"\\nBut it was to no avail. The moment she raised her voice, all her hard work was undone.",
            "Character Story 3\tXinyan has one standard by which she judges all things: is it or isn't it \"rock 'n' roll?\"\\nAll that is just and upright — standing up for those who have been wronged, taking on challenges — is \"rock 'n' roll,\" and all that is reprehensible — fearing the wicked, oppressing the kind, dirty tricks, scheming ways — is \"not rock 'n' roll.\"\\nRock is the spirit of rebellion and resistance, yes, but patently immoral acts are nonetheless \"not rock 'n' roll.\"\\nXinyan reserves the right to make these judgments, and whether these judgments are based on results or her mood, the difference between the things covered by these two opposing terms is clear.\\nThe only catch is that these standards sound odd in certain contexts.\\nDue to her fierce appearance, Xinyan nearly has no friends, with Xiangling of Wanmin Restaurant being one of the few exceptions with whom she can speak most freely.\\nXinyan has a special reason for coming to Wanmin Restaurant — for musical inspiration.\\nWhenever Xiangling is researching new recipes, others may run for the hills, but not Xinyan. She intentionally eats all the experimental products, and amid the taste bud explosion that results from the never-before-seen flavors, inspiration flows into her mind.\\n\"Tell you what, Xiangling, that dish rocked!\"\\nThough Xinyan considers this to be the highest praise, Xiangling finds it a little hard to be happy about such ratings.",
            "Character Story 4\tThe eternal subject of rock 'n' roll is resistance.\\nBut the thing that Xinyan resists is not a concrete thing, but rather, the conceptual shackles of \"prejudice.\"\\nShe was born into a poor family, and her parents placed great stock in her, giving her the best of what little they had in the hopes that she would be able to rise to \"become a phoenix.\"\\nOf course, this \"phoenix\" would have to be something that they would recognize.\\nBut things don't always turn out as planned. Xinyan grew to be taller than most girls, and her looks were far from anything that might be considered \"cute.\" Nor was she any good at any of the feminine arts, whether it was cooking, chores, needlework.\\nSo, since her childhood was so deeply impacted by such \"prejudices,\" Xinyan understands how terrifying they could be.\\nYet becoming a rock 'n' roll star has not caused her to give up on these other arts.\\nThis is not only because she hates losing, but because she feels that \"giving up because you have no talent\" is itself a prejudiced belief.\\nNot long ago, a fan of Xinyan's named Yunjin was invited to her place as a guest.\\nBut if Xinyan hadn't opened the door herself, Yunjin would have thought that she had the wrong house.\\nThe house was spick and span, the windows were clean, and the home ornaments were hand-made and immaculately arranged.\\nThe cooktop was still moist, indicating that someone had been cooking not long before, and there was half-sewn cloth by the bedside that looked much like the decorations Xinyan wore during her performances.\\nWhy, this was practically the room of some refined lady of reputable upbringing, with nary any spirit of rock 'n' roll to be found!\\nXinyan was quite worried that this fan of hers would find the difference between their impression of \"rock 'n' roll\" and this reality too jarring.\\nUnexpectedly, Yunjin's support and fandom would only grow more intense after this.",
            "Character Story 5\tThe way Xinyan sees it, many adults fail to realize their potential because they are tied down by prejudice, giving in to fear and endless anxiety.\\nThey do not understand what life is about, or where they are going.\\nShe wrote these thoughts into her songs, but invited scorn from the very same adults. \"What does this brat know?\"\\nEven so, Xinyan did not waver. After all, such mockery was born of prejudice towards her age.\\nAnd if prejudice were something so easily overthrown, there would be no value in resisting it, would there?\\nShe believes that rock 'n' roll is like a seed. After every performance, some seeds might sprout within the hearts of those adults who listen.\\nWhen they wake up the next day, perhaps they might receive some inspiration, or perhaps a change of mood will come over them...\\nEven if it only changes their thinking a little bit... Perhaps they might find that the real-life troubles they are facing are nothing but a storm in a teacup.\\nOf course, few people other than her audience and the \"friends of rock\" would credit this to rock 'n' roll.\\nBut people do nonetheless say this around the tables after tea.\\n\"Well, having a girl who plays rock 'n' roll is pretty interesting, no?\"",
            "Xinyan's Instrument\tXinyan's main instrument is a hand-made lyre of a very unique design. She based it off the rock 'n' roll instruments that were imported from Fontaine before adding additional modifications based on personal understanding.\\nFor example, she mounted a crescent-shaped axe-blade on the tail end of the instrument so it might serve as a weapon in a pinch.\\nShe also connected it to her Vision, allowing it to spew flames and sparks. Its internals can also spew flame, all the better for it to self-destruct if it falls into the wrong hands, preventing its misuse...\\nThe list of modifications goes on, and they are too numerous to count.\\nThis instrument is thus unique, and its sound profile is also special.\\n—Sorry, what? What do you mean, \"these modifications sound like they have nothing to do with music?\"\\nSounds like you, too, need to attend one of her performances. You'll understand then.",
            "Vision\tXinyan was someone who never fit in in Liyue Harbor, and she only found where she belonged when she encountered rock 'n' roll.\\nBut because she lived in a land that had no place for rock 'n' roll yet, she needed to be able to attract enough attention.\\nShe immersed herself in the world of music, looking for a way to move people's hearts. She broke many an instrument and played till calluses formed on both hands, but still, it was unsatisfactory.\\n\"Who'd want to listen to this racket?\"\\nThe rotten-tomato reviews she received were starting to get to her. She wondered if she should quit.\\nSitting on top of Mt. Tianheng, she looked down over Liyue Harbor. But though the lights lit the streets and alleys of the harbor, they could not light the flame of the spirit of rock 'n' roll.\\nShe considered leaving, to go someplace where rock 'n' roll was appreciated. But would this not be running away? Would it not be a betrayal of rock 'n' roll's spirit of resistance?\\nNo, she would not leave. She would become a \"flame\" that could light Liyue Harbor up.\\nShe started experimenting with the use of fire to move people, adding sparks and explosions to her music.\\nBut this was no mean feat for an ordinary person.\\nWho knows how many times she must have burnt her fingers or blown her instrument up. But still, she continued to practice every single day on top of Mt. Tianheng.\\nAnd perhaps it was that the gods themselves had great expectations of this new form of music that would soon grace the seven nations...\\nBut regardless, the boiling-hot Vision would be the final stroke of perfection.\\nXinyan dashed down the mountain and began her very first rock 'n' roll concert in Liyue Harbor.\\nThus did her musical journey begin, with showers of sparks and explosions keeping time."

Then, when they suddenly declined in number, the price shot up in response, but the value shown by this steelyard wasn't updated.

Although... No, surely it wouldn't come to that. She's a stickler for doing things the right way — no doubt she'd offend people... but if she had someone like me as her legal assistant... No way! Why should an eminent legal expert such as myself be relegated to the role of assistant!? If she needs legal counsel, she can come and find me.",
            "About Eula\tEula saved me once, and we've kept up correspondence ever since. She's very familiar with the Knights of Favonius' legislation, but has never been one to be bound by convention. She uses cunning logic to deal with problems flexibly... Perhaps the reason we get along so easily is that I'm a similar type myself. Still, I'll never acquire that carefree spirit of hers. We are in very different professions, after all.",

Naturally, I don't have to concern myself with adeptal affairs — I'm free to focus on the life I want to live. Works for me! Hee-hee.",
            "More About Yanfei: III\tContracts of that magnitude — lifelong commitments... I've only ever signed one with my father. Uh... it's about living happily, I suppose.

If he'd wanted me to sign a different contract, say... one about working myself into the ground, or stepping on others to achieve success... I would've ran away by now!",
            "More About Yanfei: IV\tSometimes, the commercial disputes I handle don't end very pleasantly. The other party might win compensation way in excess of the damages, or pay damages far exceeding the costs... Such is the price of violating a contract. Some people say I'm pretty terrifying, others try to avoid me altogether, but I don't need to explain myself to anyone. Since the very beginning, the welfare of Liyue has been my primary concern!\\nThink about it — the origin of disputes can be traced back to the violation of contracts. People are a lot less likely to violate contracts when they see the fallout. Making sure that people realize the importance of contracts is a crucial part of my work!",
            "More About Yanfei: V\tMost of the time, I feel that I have a happy and laid back existence. I have a successful career, clothes on my back, and the freedom to go wherever I please. I've also got quite a way with words — nobody can beat me in a debate. And yet, there is no law or standard that can define a happy life.\\nFor me... interesting people and engaging affairs, knowing where to go and which path to choose... these are all enough to bring me happiness. And on that note, you too are a source of happiness for me.\\nIn any case, whatever the life you live, the most important thing is to respect and understand the law. After all, as soon as you stray from the law, the world begins to fall to ruin.",

I've gotten the better of everyone a hundred different ways, but they continue to scrutinize my business... After so much success, it's gotten a little embarrassing... So every time, I end up taking advantage of my ingenious acting skills to make myself seem humble, you know? What's with the face — are you doubting me?",

            "Character Details\tLiyue is a port that prizes contracts and trade, and it is a place where wealth accumulates.\\nMerchants from various nations are active here, which has contributed to Liyue's abundance, but has also brought up many disagreements. The Tianquan, Ningguang, has written a very comprehensive compendium of laws to deal with this, but not everyone has the patience to study them.\\nThus was born the role of the legal adviser in Liyue society. Highly familiar with Liyue's laws, they help those in need to navigate any contradictions, earning recompense for their efforts.\\nYanfei is the premier legal adviser in Liyue Harbor.\\nShe is always able to obtain the most benefits for her clients, insofar as the law will allow. Some even call her \"the law that walks.\"\\nBut in truth, what Yanfei — one of the few half-illuminated-beasts who have yet to sign a contract with Rex Lapis — really wants to do is live a free and happy life.\\nAs for the copy of \"The General Law of Liyue\" that she carries around on her person, Yanfei has this to say:\\n\"If you don't wish to be bound by the rules, you have to first understand them all.\"",
            "Character Story 1\tAs the most sought-after legal adviser in Liyue Harbor, Yanfei's rates are also top-of-the-line.\\nEven so, she never lacks for people coming to seek appointments. After all, merchants are not stingy about mediation fees, but are very picky indeed about the mediator.\\n\"Money is no object — we must have Yanfei come and settle this matter for us.\"\\nMany rate Yanfei in this fashion, not only for her quick-thinking or her masterful oratory, but also because she very greatly emphasizes the cornerstone of the law — \"fairness.\"\\nHer mediations often end in win-win situations, and even merchants with daggers drawn will temporarily set their prejudices aside.\\nThough she is unbound by a contract, Yanfei has made her own contribution to the peace and prosperity of Liyue.",
            "Character Story 2\tAs a legal adviser, Yanfei does have her fair share of weaknesses. An example is the mediation of civil disputes that involve emotions and relationships.\\nDivorces, inheritances, custody disputes, senior care, severances... The list continues.\\nIt is said that upright officials are hapless in household affairs, and so it also is with Yanfei, who grew up surrounded by love — these matters fall right into her blind corner.\\nSometimes, she will find that both sides have reason on their side, and other times she will find them to both be unreasonable. Child custody disputes are the absolute worst, as no matter how she settles them, the settlement will have a great psychological impact on the innocent children. Even if Yanfei chooses to soldier on, she will only tire herself out.\\n\"Hopefully, everyone can meet the right person and be spared this particular grief.\"",
            "Character Story 3\tAs a result of her greatly tolerant nature, Yanfei has a wide variety of personal relationships throughout Liyue.\\nThere is no need to worry about rubbing a sore spot, and you'll be able to get along with her whether you're an avid conversationalist or not.\\nOf course, this is true as long as you don't attempt to debate with her or start a conversation about the legal profession... Yanfei in work mode is a completely different beast to deal with.\\nAdditionally, Yanfei has cultivated the habit of being overly rigorous from her long years of studying the law. When chatting, Yanfei will vigorously eliminate any ambiguity or loopholes present in the discourse and can seem like a bit of a chatterbox. When she realizes this, Yanfei is wont to knock herself on the head with a book in irritation.\\nHowever, so long as she constantly bathes in a sea of legal literature, this habit will probably be quite hard to break.",
            "Character Story 4\tWhen investigating the law, Yanfei's habit is to look past the cold letters of the law to perceive their point of origin.\\nAs such, she is also something of a master of \"reading comprehension\" in her relationships.\\nOnce, the Traveler met Yanfei by chance and said, \"Huh. Didn't expect to see you here.\"\\nThis should have been a line that one might hear just about anywhere, but it wound up holding a completely different meaning for Yanfei.\\n\"Didn't expect to meet you here\" implied that the Traveler had at least thought about a scenario in which they would meet. Then why the use of \"didn't expect\"? One could only postulate that the Traveler had some expectation of where she might appear, and that her current location was not such a place. But whence came the expectation? Could it be that the Traveler had always been paying attention to her in secret?\\n\"Does this mean that the Traveler...?\"\\nYanfei tossed and turned in bed that night, unable to sleep.",
            "Character Story 5\tYanfei's most prized possession is the steelyard balance that her father gave her.\\nIt is said that this balance was a treasure given by Rex Lapis that can be used to measure the value of all things. For convenience, Yanfei tends to use Mora to balance the scales, which is to say that she uses Mora to evaluate objects.\\nThe prices of many objects have slowly changed over the years, but weighing an object with this balance only gives its value at the time Mora was created, leaving the rest to Yanfei to exercise her own wisdom and judgment.\\nAcross the measurements of countless objects, Yanfei is able to see the changes in Liyue. Some objects that were once common have become vanishingly rare, and some exotic objects of the past have been rendered pedestrian today.\\nThis steelyard balance reminds her that many things cannot be valued by the standards of the world.\\nYanfei once tried to weigh the value of a Vision, but no matter how much Mora she added, the scales would not be balanced.\\nIn frustration, she placed on the scale the box at her waist, which contained her heavy, handwritten legal notations. Only then did the weights at last even out.",
            "Codex Finalem\tThis is the most special of the many legal treatises that Yanfei collects.\\nAs opposed to the codices that grow heavier and more complicated with time, this book is unbelievably light and thin.\\nAfter opening it and getting past the prologue, one will find naught but the most basic few principles of the law inscribed.\\nAs Yanfei sees it, this is the final form of the law. In the far future, the law will have entered into the people's hearts. All people will be amiable, modest, and live happily in this world. The halls of judgment will lie empty and the mountains of legalese shall be caked in years of dust.\\nThough this may sound like something very far off, for someone like Yanfei, in whom flows the blood of an illuminated beast, living till that day is hardly a great accomplishment.\\n\"Hmm, but if I think about it more deeply, I'd be out of a job then, wouldn't I?\"\\nAfter encountering one of Xinyan's performances by chance, Yanfei was quite taken by this new wave of performance art.\\nThat said, learning an instrument from scratch proved to be a bit difficult, so after consulting a great many resources, Yanfei came to what she considered to be a decent backup plan.\\nIf such a day were to arrive, she would just become a rapper.\\nFor someone who can recite tens of thousands of words' worth of Liyue law from front to back within an hour, speed at least should be no challenge.",
            "Vision\tYanfei's father is an illuminated beast, while her mother is an ordinary mortal merchant. Born into peaceful times, Yanfei did not sign a contract with Rex Lapis, but instead has one with her parents to \"live happily.\"\\nAs Liyue's leading legal exegete, she is no stranger to exploiting some existing loopholes in the law — at times for herself, and sometimes for others.\\nIt has been made clear often enough that Yanfei is not a stickler for the rules and has no wish to be shackled by strictures.\\nStill, she contributes to the betterment of Liyue as she seeks her own pleasure, and will not use these loopholes for ill.\\nWhen making amendments to legal loopholes each year, Ningguang the Tianquan will often study Yanfei's doings, as if she were Liyue's unofficial legal troubleshooter.\\nIn a sense, one could argue that Yanfei makes the laws better at the lowest possible price... This principle is also the reason why she has never been convicted of exploiting any such loopholes.\\nYanfei believes in \"no structure without laws,\" and what she wishes for is to \"live as one pleases without overstepping.\"\\nEveryone in Liyue, adeptus or mortal, protects it in their own way.\\nThat is why Yanfei possesses a Vision, one that is of equal weight to her principles."

I prepared a huge boat-shaped firework just to surprise her — and when the Crux Fleet was about to leave, this firework went whoosh! Right in front of their eyes, straight into the sky. The sailors got such a huge fright — they thought one of their ships had somehow flown off! But Beidou liked that trick very much, saying that it was exactly what a pleasant surprise should be — very pleasant, and a surprise.",

She probably feels that their transient glory has no practical purpose in Inazuma. *sigh* It's probably something that one who has \"eternity\" in their grasp will find hard to comprehend. It is precisely because we mortals are like fleeting shadows that we need to treasure such flickers of beauty.",

I thought to myself, \"isn't the Lady Guuji supposed to sit inside the shrine throughout the ritual?\" So I watched her the whole time during the ritual, wondering how she'd like to release the fireworks. I waited, and I waited, and then Ayaka came over at length to tell me that the Lady Guuji was most pleased. I mean, what? She'd already released the fireworks? Was the person sitting inside the shrine not her, then?",
            "About Arataki Itto: Duels\tOh, he may look scary, but he is very popular with the children. However, he can be very competitive. Every time we play with the children, it always turns into a showdown between him and me. For example, we'd drink a bowl of ramen soup in one go, or try to eat sour plums without making any faces. The children will cheer us both on and try to guess the winner. And when that happens... well, then I can't let him beat me, right?",

            "About Kaedehara Kazuha\tPeople with no worries like myself speak plainly, while those with many cares often speak of ancient poetry or the scenery.

            "About Kujou Sara\tDue to public safety and fire hazard-related concerns, I often get whisked off to the Tenryou Commission's place for a lecture. Kujou Sara's probably the most reasonable of the bunch. At least she'll hear me out before passing any judgment. If I'm in the right, she'll acknowledge my perspective, and if I'm wrong...

Fireworks are not eternal, but I believe that the wonderful emotions behind them should walk alongside Inazuma into eternity.",

            "Character Details\tYoimiya's name is renowned throughout Hanamizaka.\\nShe is the most skilled pyrotechnician in Inazuma and is known as the \"Queen of the Summer Festival.\"\\nYoimiya, who has inherited the mantle of \"Naganohara\", is able to give people an unparalleled experience with her ever-changing and spectacular fireworks.\\nIn addition to being a craftsperson, she is also the \"heroic sister\" in the eyes of many children. No matter how big the problem is, Yoimiya always has a solution to save the day.\\nBe it the illusions of fear or the shadows of cold reality, they will all dissipate under the starlight magic of Yoimiya's fireworks.\\nThe children are not the only ones she helps — as long as one is willing to talk to her about their troubles, she will lend a helping hand, and try her best to help them through the crisis.\\nSplendid fireworks, warm starlight and passionate lights all join in a swirling dance in Yoimiya's hands. Her bright smile is always able to inspire fellow travelers and light up the way for them.",
            "Character Story 1\tTo Inazumans, fireworks symbolize summer.\\nThe various festivals that take place at fixed times feature a rotation of various events, with fireworks being the sole constant.\\nOver a century ago, the Yashiro Commission once organized a dazzling fireworks display with \"commemoration\" as the theme.\\nThe fireworks then were made by the greatest pyrotechnicians in the land, and this was the origin of the Naganohara Fireworks Show.\\nIn latter days, fireworks would become more common, and the Naganohara Fireworks Show would slowly become an event in which all people would participate.\\nDuring the Fireworks Show, everyone can light their favorite fireworks, and the owner of the Naganohara Fireworks store will pick an appropriate time to set up a most lavish performance.\\nThe year Yoimiya took over, her first fiesta was already jaw-droppingly good.\\nOn the night before that Fireworks Show, Kamisato Ayaka enjoined Yoimiya thusly: \"Her Excellency will be watching this fireworks display personally. As such, please add Her Excellency's emblem — the Electro Mistudomoe — into the fireworks repertoire, if you would.\"\\n\"Haha, just wait for it!\" Yoimiya replied, agreeing with great confidence.\\nBefore the show could begin, Yoimiya ran all about the city, placing thousands of launch tubes in every nook and cranny. At the festival's finale, the blazing fireworks formed a gigantic picture scroll that depicted the city of Inazuma in the skies.\\nYet Ayaka did not find the critical emblem in any one of these fireworks, and wondered if Yoimiya had made an error in her arrangements.\\nIt was only after speaking with Yoimiya that Ayaka discovered that the image of Inazuma in the skies had an \"angling\" trick added to it.\\nIf viewed from the Tenshukaku, the fireworks would form a huge, clear, and orderly image of the Raiden Shogun's house-crest — with some playfully lacy decorations on the side to boot.\\nOf course, how could Yoimiya miss a beat at a fireworks performance? This way, she won the praise of both the people and the Raiden Shogun, and this feast would become a timeless classic deeply rooted in the memories of countless people.\\nWith Yoimiya around, the Inazuman summer shall not lack any glorious fireworks — thus was her nickname, \"Queen of the Summer Festival,\" coined.",
            "Character Story 2\tNaganohara's fireworks are loved by all, and work in the shop is always in full swing. As such, people often feel that coming up to the door without important matters might hinder the work.\\nHowever, it's just the opposite with Yoimiya, for chatting is her other great hobby. In fact, if there's no one to talk to, she might actually find it hard to focus.\\nIf chatting with the guest is her way of \"understanding their mood and way of thinking, such that the best fireworks can be crafted,\" then going with the flow and sitting down for tea and an idle chat with them after delivering the goods is how Yoimiya rewards herself. Sometimes, if that is not enough, she will make some small-talk with her neighbors on the way, give them some small trinkets, and receive a basket of small treats in return...\\nYoimiya is always able to strike a balance between listening and speaking in such chats.\\nShe doesn't repeat herself, doesn't cross boundaries, doesn't come off as indifferent or overly invested. After a talk over tea, everyone leaves in a good mood.\\nHer neighbors are all ordinary folk, and their lives are not exactly full of extraordinary things. Sometimes, the same news will be told by different people over and over, but Yoimiya does not find this upsetting.\\nWhat she enjoys is the process of talking to others — even if they speak of the same matter, different people will have different viewpoints.\\nAfter taking over the fireworks shop, Yoimiya's relationships with her neighbors became still more harmonious. Many old folks have taken her for an old acquaintance, and often invite her to their place to sit and recount the festivals of yesteryear. Middle-aged parents will ask Yoimiya to mediate the relationship between themselves and their children and will regale her with the little trivialities of daily family life. The young people treat Yoimiya as a sibling of sorts, volunteering to help her cart heavy fireworks-making materials around, hoping that Yoimiya will get off work faster and take the children out to play.\\nYoimiya puts it this way: \"I believe in the unique power of language. There's nothing that can't be talked through somehow!\"",
            "Character Story 3\tCraftsmen seeking perfection are often rigorous and self-disciplined, but Yoimiya is an exception, acting freely and taking unscheduled breaks.\\nSometimes, she even has to work late into the night when she misses her daytime work due to chatting for too long. But when the sun begins to rise, she will climb up to the heights to see the sunrise with a sense of accomplishment at having finished her work in her heart. Looking out at the hazy amber-gold clouds, Yoimiya often gains new inspiration, imagining all manners of new fireworks in her mind, even as sleep draws near...\\nHer neighbors have often found her sleeping in places like eaves, tree branches, and stopped waterwheels. Sometimes, she even falls down, before blearily watching her sweet dreams and golden stars fade away into the distance.\\nFortunately, she has never been seriously injured in such incidents, but she has gotten a number of scrapes and cuts, and it was on that account that she learned how to deal with wounds.\\nAt some other times, Yoimiya will sleep until midnight, settling all matters with gusto before heading out for a stroll.\\nPerhaps it may turn out to be an impromptu adventure, or perhaps a test of courage. If a friend is interested, she might call upon them. If she wishes to be alone, she will travel in solitude.\\nLiving as she pleases gives Yoimiya a sense of freedom. As for others, they may encounter her at any time at all. She enjoys this freedom, often saying that it has made her life very interesting indeed.\\nOf course, she will restrain herself on the eve of celebrations. Mistakes shall not be made during these all-important performances — her \"official business.\"",
            "Character Story 4\tApart from selling fireworks, Naganohara Fireworks also sells various intricate knickknacks. This can be said to be Yoimiya's second career.\\nAll manner of trinkets adorn the shelves, with some of them being exotic imports from Beidou that were modified and made into highly distinctive handicrafts, and others being practice works created during bursts of Yoimiya's explosive inspiration.\\nFrom the Scatterbloom Marbles that will blossom when they knock against each other, Leaping Tops that chirp like birds as they spin, the Neon Dragonfly that changes hue as it ascends into the air, and the somewhat-failed Onikabuto Chariot... All these toys are inspired by the little games that the common people play.\\nThey are not only popular among the children, but are much-loved by adults as well. Even Arataki Itto, the head of the Arataki Gang, comes over to buy her specially-made knickknacks, which he then brings to go challenge the one he has declared his nemesis.\\nYoimiya's knickknacks are not just toys. With some thought, they can be very useful in one's daily life. The most classic example of this is the Katydid Coil, which is a ring that can contain a variety of flammables and spices. When ignited and hung up in the summer, it can be used to repel mosquitoes.\\nMany people have come to ask Yoimiya for help on account of her excellent craftsmanship. And though she protests, saying, \"Hey now, this is a fireworks shop, not an everything shop. Even I can't possibly do it all,\" she will still try her best to help, even if her earnings for the whole day are only enough to buy a few snacks. She'll enjoy the whole thing, too — everyone in Hanamizaka is her friend, after all.",
            "Character Story 5\t\"The rainbows become fireworks, and they my wishes know, my wishes rise into the skies, and through the night they show.\"\\nThis nameless folksong has been around for a long time now. In recent years, it was misconstrued by the children to mean that as long as they brought some shiny trinkets, they could exchange them with Yoimiya for fireworks that belong just to them, and that if they lit those fireworks up, their wish will come true at some point in the future.\\nAs such, the children of Hanamizaka set about searching for beautiful little trinkets with this song on their lips, before bringing them to Yoimiya, with expectation eagarly written on their faces.\\nYoimiya was quite troubled by this at first, but after hearing how the children had interpreted that song, she accepted their requests gladly and even added her own spin to the tale: the \"rainbows\" in the song not only refer to shiny treasures persay. As long as she found them \"sufficiently shiny,\" whether they were colored rocks from the creeks or shell fragments from the beaches, she would take them and make lovely fireworks as per the agreement.\\nIndeed, if they were to bring her expensive things, she might, in turn, say that they are too ordinary, and take the child to look for the owner of those lost goods.\\nBut it really did not matter if the treasures were shiny or not. The important part was the conviction the children had that \"rainbows\" could indeed be exchanged for \"fireworks.\"\\nThough some might take it for naivete, Yoimiya will give her all to protect the lovely wishes that only children can have.\\n\"The things we believed in and experienced as children become irreplaceable treasures.\"\\nThe legendary picture books of Inazuma are often filled with the following images: the cute and playful Great Mujina Youkai, the majestic Shiba Warrior, the Origami Nue who appears out of nowhere...\\nPerhaps those who drew demons in such cute forms also had a similar intention to Yoimiya.\\nThe children gather around Yoimiya, enjoying a gladsome time even amidst Inazuma's lockdown.\\nYoimiya's own child-like heart and liveliness never dulls, like fireworks and stars that shimmer and shine in the night sky.",
            "Yoimiya's Candy Box: \"Sweet Pearl\"\tEvery festival, Yoimiya not only tries snacks from every store, but she also collects all sorts of candies, wraps them up with care, before storing them away inside a small candy box.\\nYoimiya's candy box is a small crimson ball that has been decorated with delicate lanyards and ornate accessories, much like the hair accessories she often wears.\\nEach time she encounters a joyous event, she will take one candy out of the box and eat it. If her friends or the children are around, she will share the sweets with them.\\nYoimiya's neighbors often mistake her hair ornaments for the candy box, hence its erroneous nickname \"Sweet Pearl.\"\\nThe speed at which the box lightens is taken for an important measure of happiness.\\nThe quicker it empties, the more pleased Yoimiya is.\\nSometimes, when things get busy, she sometimes absently uses the candy box as a hair accessory, realizing her mistake only after the day is done.\\nStill, even this error would inspire Yoimiya. From then on, she would wear them interchangeably.\\n\"Take a guess: does my hair ornament have candy in it today? Free pick of the sweets to anyone who gets it right!\"",
            "Vision\tYoimiya is always up for a chat. It is only when the fireworks are ascending into the skies that she quiets down and just watches the lovely scenery.\\nPeople often say that fireworks come and go in a fleeting heartbeat, but if they are memorable enough, they will remain in bloom forever in people's hearts.\\nThose who accompanied you and the loveliness of the moment itself, will burrow deep into your mind as a beautiful memory.\\nAnd as you look upon the same fireworks, many years later, that same memory and the feelings that came with it will surely rise again to the forefront of your heart.\\nIs this not also \"Eternity\"?\\nThe special firework formula slips that belong solely to the Naganohara family exist for precisely this purpose.\\nBy incorporating goodwill and wishes into the gorgeous fireworks, ephemeral things are etched into eternity. This is the meaning of Yoimiya's line of work.\\nOn one summer night following her taking over Naganohara Fireworks, Yoimiya could not sleep, and thus she continued in her research till daylight came.\\nSuddenly, she heard a tinkling sound, and a burning-red object fell into an unused launching tube.\\nAt first, Yoimiya used her Vision as a sort of lighter. Fortunately, her father discovered it and explained a Vision's significance to her.\\nSo, this tiny gem could grant a person astonishing and mysterious powers. And yet what else could it do other than protect the children or chase some mischievous monsters away?\\n\"Even if it could have other uses,\" Yoimiya thought, \"it may not ever need to do these things in my hands. I'm just someone who pursues happiness, a fireworks-maker who enjoys living life.\"\\nTime has flown since then, and Yoimiya has grown ever more skilled in the manipulation of \"fire,\" with her skill at making fireworks having likewise increased.\\nSometimes, she stops to ask herself this: \"How did someone as ordinary as me receive the acknowledgment of the gods? Do the gods... enjoy fireworks, by any chance?\""

As long as it catches his eye, Zhongli will pay as much as the owner asks. Indeed, he will even buy it at a premium sometimes.\\nBut for some reason, Zhongli always forgets to bring money.\\nFor small purchases, he has friends to help him out, and large bills he somehow finds ways to have written off.\\nTo those merchants who secretly pride themselves on their powers of flattery, Zhongli is a man of strange proclivities: in truth, he knows a great deal about the value of money and finance, and he also understands the suffering of the people. However, he seems to not understand that poverty is part of the human condition.\\nOr perhaps it might be said that he cannot imagine himself being poor.\\nHow has such a person not died of hunger yet?",
            "Character Story 3\tThere is no way Zhongli can starve.\\nSuch concerns as profit and loss are beneath his notice. The Seven Nations and the world itself are where his efforts are directed.\\nAs for wealth... He is wealth itself.\\nHe is Morax, the overlord Rex Lapis who rules Liyue, and the Geo Archon of the Seven Archons. The very money that circulates throughout Teyvat, Mora, is named after him.\\nWhen night falls and bustling Liyue begins to slumber, he will sometimes stand atop the towering mountains and gaze upon this city, which he made with his own hands.\\nTo the people of Liyue, Rex Lapis has many divine titles.\\nWhen he laid down Liyue's laws by his divine might, he was the God of Contracts. When he minted the first Mora and made Liyue strong by dint of commerce, the merchants revered him as the God of Commerce.\\nHe has lived through countless years and is the eldest of the Seven, and so historians call him the God of History.\\nThousands of years ago, the forebears of the citizens of Liyue Harbor struck stones together to start fires and used piled stones to create stoves. These blessings derived from the Geo element led the Geo Archon to gain the title of God of the Stove.\\nPeople from other lands tend to call him Morax, though the people of Liyue prefer to use the term Rex Lapis.\\nBut in the hearts of lovers of opera and children, Morax's on-stage aspect, the all-conquering defender of Liyue — the Warrior God — is the most fascinating.\\nThe delicacies that Rex Lapis discovered while lost in the streets, the plaques inscribed with his handwriting, a famous opera that he once starred in, playing the part of a warrior... Many stories and tales of Liyue are, when studied closely, stories of people visited by their deity at some point — and the citizens of Liyue are most proud indeed of that history.",
            "Character Story 4\tAs the founder of Liyue Harbor, \"contracts\" are the most important thing to Morax.\\nFrom simple monetary exchange and agreements between merchants to the ancient laws that Morax himself laid down, there is no part of city life untouched by \"contracts.\"\\nTo merchants, \"contracts\" are the most important standard to which they hold themselves: deadlines, invoices, shipping destinations... Only a refined and strict order can sustain vibrant commerce, which is itself the lifeblood of Liyue Harbor.\\nThus the Qixing punish violators of such laws unceasingly, not only to uphold the divine rulings of Morax but also to allow Liyue to maintain its vitality.\\nThrough the millennia, every generation of the Liyue Qixing commits to interpreting the law, including subtle amendments to plug loopholes found in the law. Any loopholes that remain undiscovered are seen by the merchants as \"permissible if unaddressed,\" and they make killings off such holes until they are discovered and patched up by the Liyue Qixing.\\nAmid this game of cat-and-mouse, the book that collates such amendments has reached a whopping 279 pages thick.\\nThe person currently responsible for maintaining this book, the Tianquan Ningguang, is secretly (and humorously) referred to as the \"Tailor of Liyue,\" in honor of her speed in patching these laws up, and for her sharpness of eye.\\nBut no matter how complicated or tangled mortal laws become, one of these stands above all others in the eyes of Rex Lapis.\\n\"The one who reneges on their words shall suffer the Wrath of the Rock.\"",
            "Character Story 5\tRex Lapis, most ancient of The Seven, has lived far too long.\\nRex Lapis still remembers that moment when the final archon took their divine seat, thus ending the Archon War and the era of warring gods. The Seven were a diverse lot and dispersed far and wide, but they all shouldered the burden of guiding humanity.\\nAs time passed, many of The Seven's titles changed hands, and only two remain of the first Seven: Rex Lapis and the Anemo Archon.\\nThe carefree Barbatos, the Anemo Archon, is the second eldest of The Seven.\\nWhen Barbatos first came to Liyue, Rex Lapis believed his fellow archon to have encountered some terrible crisis in pursuit of their duties, thus requiring his aid.\\nSo when Barbatos descended in a gust of wind, the Geo Archon had already prepared himself to receive this neighboring deity and lend what help he may.\\nBut as he looked, the Anemo Archon tossed a wine bottle at him.\\n\"Here's some wine from Mondstadt. Care for a taste?\"\\nTo forsake one's duty to deliver a single bottle of wine — what a preposterous notion!\\nYet the Anemo Archon kept coming to visit, to explore Liyue Harbor, all sorts of strange questions on his lips. The Anemo Archon's questions knew as little limits as the wine in his hands.\\nFrom then on, the first Seven would often gather in Liyue.\\nRex Lapis still remembers how those wines tasted.\\nThe world has changed much since then, and all that was once familiar has faded into memory.\\nThe seven seats changed and again were changed, till five of the seven at the table were all departed.\\nNor would the duty of guiding humanity be honored by the new archons.\\nEven the hardest rocks may be worn down after three thousand years.\\nNor would the wind ever return again.\\nOne drizzly day, the ancient ruler was strolling about Liyue Harbor, and overheard a merchant telling one of his workers,\\n\"You've finished your duties, go ahead and call it a day.\"\\nLong did he stand amidst the milling crowd.\\n\"Have I... already finished my duties?\"",
            "That Which Rises From the Sea\tDuring the Archon Wars, every corner of Teyvat was consumed in the fires of conflict. Not only did gods fight amongst themselves, but countless wicked things also sought to expand their domains.\\nOne such type of creature caused no end of woe for the Geo Archon, long before he took that title along with his place among The Seven.\\nThese foul creatures, straight from the murky depths of the ocean abyss, had a squishy exterior, and possessed agile tentacles that would live on even after being cut off, even secreting some thick and revolting fluid in the process.\\nThis alone would have been enough to make them the most monstrous of all creatures, and still it was not the pinnacle of their monstrosity.\\nWhat made them so truly terrible was their small size, which gave them the ability to duck into unimaginably small nooks and crannies.\\nNo space was too narrow for them, neither the wooden boards of tables and chairs, nor the seams of windows and doors and curtain folds, nor even books and brushes.\\nMany a poor soul had, on at least one occasion, unwittingly outstretched their hand, only to quickly retract it in horror with a blood-curdling scream at the sensation of something cold, clammy and damp, while one or more of these despicable creatures came crawling up their arm, leaving a shiny trail behind them...\\nAt the behest of the people of Liyue, Morax agreed to wipe these creatures out. But these parasites upon civilization could not be destroyed like enemies on a battlefield, by simply summoning a storm of stone spears that would shatter the earth and churn the soil....\\nStill, he was the God of Contracts. His word had to be his bond.\\nSo, he went through the town from house to house with prisons of stone, seizing these creatures one by one and locking them away for good...\\nThis long campaign of pest extermination taught Morax the true meaning of \"a burden lifted.\"\\nThe grueling campaign itself, and the terrible smell of those ocean creatures' secretions, left a lasting impression on the deity.\\nToday, even when he goes out incognito as the mortal man, Zhongli, Morax gives those living, squirming seafood products a wide berth.\\n...Well, except for dishes where said seafood products have been sliced and diced into oblivion, such as seafood tofu. He'll quite happily eat those.",
            "Vision\tOnce the Rite of Parting, of which Zhongli was both director and star, was over, the Fatui Harbinger named Signora appeared before him.\\nBy prior contract, she was here to claim the Geo Archon Morax's Gnosis.\\nBefore the Traveler and the two Fatui Harbingers, Zhongli related the truth that he had established a contract with the Cryo Archon.\\nIn his own words, this was his final \"Contract to End All Contracts.\"\\nYet no matter how one looks at it, the loss of his divine ability to defend Liyue was too great a price to pay.\\nEven amongst mortals, the basis of a contract is \"equivalent exchange.\"\\nAnd for the God of Contracts, who must have established countless such agreements in his long years of existence, such an important contract must have come with its benefits.\\nNow, the Geo Archon has given away his Gnosis as his part of the deal.\\nWhat, then, must the Cryo Archon have wagered to balance the scales?"
